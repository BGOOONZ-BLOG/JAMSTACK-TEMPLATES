/**
 * This class wraps the child process and provides a nice interface to
 * communicate with. It takes care of:
 *
 *  - Re-spawning the process if it dies.
 *  - Queues calls while the worker is busy.
 *  - Re-sends the requests if the worker blew up.
 *
 * The reason for queueing them here (since childProcess.send also has an
 * internal queue) is because the worker could be doing asynchronous work, and
 * this would lead to the child process to read its receiving buffer and start a
 * second call. By queueing calls here, we don't send the next call to the
 * children until we receive the result of the previous one.
 *
 * As soon as a request starts to be processed by a worker, its "processed"
 * field is changed to "true", so that other workers which might encounter the
 * same call skip it.
