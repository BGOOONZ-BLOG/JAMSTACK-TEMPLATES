# Getting Started

> ⚠️ Since v1 you need `react` and `react-dom` with `>= 16.8.0` installed.

## Migration Guide

This documentation it's about **v2**. If you need to migrate your Docz project, please read our [**Migration Guide**](/docs/migration-guide).
If you are looking for documentation for v1 it's [**here**](https://docz-v1.surge.sh/)

## Installation

Getting started with **Docz** is something really easy and quick.
First of all, you will need to install **Docz** using your favorite package manager:

```bash
$ yarn add docz@next react react-dom
```
or
```bash
$ npm add docz@next react react-dom
```

> ### Warnings and tips
> Don't forget to install **react** and **react-dom**

> After you installed Docz in your project, you may find it convenient to add two scripts in your `package.json` to run Docz for you. This is an **optional step**:

```json
{
  "name": "next-gen-documentation",
  "scripts": {
    "docz:dev": "docz dev",
    "docz:build": "docz build"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "docz": "latest",
    "react": "16.8.0",
    "react-dom": "16.8.0"
  }
}
```

Now you can spin up your dev server by running:

```bash
$ yarn docz:dev
```
or
```bash
$ npm run docz:dev
```

## Using

With your dev server up, you can start writing your documentation. Docz uses [**MDX**](https://mdxjs.com/) as a standard
format because of the flexibility of writing JSX inside markdown files.

> Note that you **don't need to follow any strict file architecture**. You can just create your `.mdx` files **anywhere in your project**.

So, let's create our first `.mdx` and give it a name and a route:

```markdown
---
name: Hello world
route: /
---

# Hello world

Hello, I'm a mdx file!
```

With your first `.mdx` created, you can open your browser and visit `localhost:3000` and you should see something like this:

_MDX_ is markdown with extra everything. We cover more on what you can do with _MDX_ under [**Writing MDX**](/docs/writing-mdx)
