# gatsby-transformer-hjson

Parses raw [HJSON](https://hjson.org/) strings into JavaScript objects e.g. from
HJSON files. Supports arrays of objects and single objects.

## Install

`npm install --save gatsby-transformer-hjson`

You also need to have `gatsby-source-filesystem` installed and configured so it
points to your files.

## How to use

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [`gatsby-transformer-hjson`],
}
```

## Parsing algorithm

You can choose to structure your data as arrays of objects in individual files
or as single objects spread across multiple files.

### Array of Objects

The algorithm for arrays is to convert each item in the array into a node.

So if your project has a `letters.hjson` with `[{ value: a } { value: b } { value: c }]` then the following three nodes would be created.

```javascript
;[
  { value: "a", type: "Letters" },
  { value: "b", type: "Letters" },
  { value: "c", type: "Letters" },
]
```

### Single Object

The algorithm for single JSON objects is to convert the object defined at the
root of the file into a node. The type of the node is based on the name of the
parent directory.

For example, lets say your project has a data layout like:

```text
    data/
        letters/
            a.hjson
            b.hjson
            c.hjson
```

Where each of `a.hjson`, `b.hjson` and `c.hjson` look like:

```json
value: a
```

```json
value: b
```

```json
value: c
```

Then the following three nodes would be created.

```javascript
;[
  {
    value: "a",
    type: "Letters",
  },
  {
    value: "b",
    type: "Letters",
  },
  {
    value: "c",
    type: "Letters",
  },
]
```

## How to query

Regardless of whether you choose to structure your data in arrays of objects or
single objects, you'd be able to query your letters like:

```graphql
{
  allLettersJson {
    edges {
      node {
        value
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Which would return:

```javascript
{
  allLettersJson: {
    edges: [
      {
        node: {
          value: "a",
        },
      },
      {
        node: {
          value: "b",
        },
      },
      {
        node: {
          value: "c",
        },
      },
    ]
  }
}
```
