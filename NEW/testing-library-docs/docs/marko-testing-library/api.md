`Marko Testing Library` re-exports everything from `DOM Testing Library` as well
as these methods:

- [`render`](#render)
- [`cleanup`](#cleanup)

---

## `render`

```javascript
function render(
  template, // A Marko template to render
  input, // Input for the above template
  options // You won't often use this, expand below for docs on options
)
```

Render into a container which is appended to `document.body`.

```javascript
import { render } from '@marko/testing-library'
import MyTemplate from './my-template.marko'

render(MyTemplate)
```

```javascript
import { render, cleanup } from '@marko/testing-library'
import 'jest-dom/extend-expect'
import Greeting from './greeting.marko'

afterEach(cleanup)

test('renders a message', async () => {
  const { container, getByText } = await render(Greeting, { name: 'Marko' })
  expect(getByText(/Marko/)).toBeInTheDocument()
  expect(container.firstChild).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    <h1>Hello, Marko!</h1>
  `)
})
```

> Note
>
> The [cleanup](#cleanup) function should be called between tests to remove the
> created DOM nodes and keep the tests isolated.

### `render` Options

You won't often need to specify options, but if you ever do, here are the
available options which you could provide as the third argument to `render`.

#### `container`

By default for client side tests, `Marko Testing Library` will create a `div`
and append that `div` to the `document.body` and this is where your component
will be rendered. If you provide your own HTMLElement `container` via this
option, it will not be appended to the `document.body` automatically.

For example: If you are unit testing a `tablebody` element, it cannot be a child
of a `div`. In this case, you can specify a `table` as the render `container`.

```javascript
const table = document.createElement('table')

const { container } = await render(MyTableBody, null, {
  container: document.body.appendChild(table),
})
```

## `render` Result

The `render` method returns a promise which resolves with an object that has a
few properties:

### `...queries`

The most important feature of `render` is that the queries from
[DOM Testing Library](dom-testing-library/api-queries.md) are automatically
returned with their first argument bound to the results of rendering your
component.

See [Queries](dom-testing-library/api-queries.md) for a complete list.

**Example**

```javascript
const { getByLabelText, queryAllByTestId } = await render(MyTemplate)
```

### `debug`

This method is a shortcut for logging the `prettyDOM` for all children inside of
the `container`.

```javascript
import { render } from '@marko/testing-library'
import Greeting from './greeting.marko'

const { debug } = await render(Greeting, { name: 'World' })
debug()

// <h1>Hello World</h1>
// you can also pass an element: debug(getByTestId('messages'))
```

This is a simple wrapper around `prettyDOM` which is also exposed and comes from
[`DOM Testing Library`](https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/blob/master/README.md#prettydom).

### `rerender`

A Marko components `input` can change at any time from a parent component.
Although often this input is passed through your component declaratively,
sometimes it is necessary to ensure that your components reacts appropriately to
new data. You can simulate your component receiving new `input` by passing new
data to the `rerender` helper.

```javascript
import { render } from '@marko/testing-library'
import Greeting from './greeting.marko'

const { rerender, debug } = await render(Greeting, { name: 'World' })

// re-render the same component with different props
await rerender({ name: 'Marko' })

debug()
// <h1>Hello Marko</h1>
```

### `emitted`

Marko components also communicate with their parents through events. It is
recommended to also test that your components emit the right events at the right
time.

The `emitted` helper does just that. Calling the helper will return all emitted
events since the last call to the helper. You can also pass in an event type to
filter the results.

```javascript
import { render, fireEvent } from '@marko/testing-library'
import Counter from './counter.marko'

const { getByText, emitted } = await render(Counter)

const button = getByText('Increment')

fireEvent.click(button)
fireEvent.click(button)

// Assuming the `Counter` component forwards these button clicks as `increment` events
expect(emitted('increment')).toHaveProperty('length', 2)

fireEvent.click(button)

// Note: the tracked events are cleared every time you read them.
// Below we are snapshoting the events after our last assertion,
// the return value will include an array with all of the arguments for each increment event.
expect(emitted('increment')).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    Array [
      Array [
        Object {
          "count": 3,
        },
      ],
    ]
`)

// Without an event type will give you all events with their type and arguments.
expect(emitted()).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    Array [
      Object {
        "args": Array [
          Object {
            "count": 0,
          },
        ],
        "type": "increment",
      },
      Object {
        "args": Array [
          Object {
            "count": 1,
          },
        ],
        "type": "increment",
      },
      Object {
        "args": Array [
          Object {
            "count": 3,
          },
        ],
        "type": "increment",
      }
    ]
  `)
```

### `container`

The containing DOM node of your rendered Marko Component. For server side tests
this is a [JSDOM.fragment](), and for client side tests this will be whatever is
passed as the `container` render option.

> Tip: To get the root element of your rendered element, use
> `container.firstChild`.

> ðŸš¨ If you find yourself using `container` to query for rendered elements then
> you should reconsider! The other queries are designed to be more resilient to
> changes that will be made to the component you're testing. Avoid using
> `container` to query for elements!

## `cleanup`

With client side tests your components are rendered into a placeholder
HTMLElement. To ensure that your components are properly removed, and destroyed,
you can call `cleanup` at any time which will remove any attached components.

```javascript
import { cleanup } from '@marko/testing-library'
// automatically unmount and cleanup DOM after the test is finished.
afterEach(cleanup)
```

To save some typing, you could also import a file with the above.

```javascript
import '@marko/testing-library/cleanup-after-each'
```

If you are using Jest, you can simply include the following to your Jest config
to avoid doing this in each file.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...,
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['@marko/testing-library/cleanup-after-each']
}
```
