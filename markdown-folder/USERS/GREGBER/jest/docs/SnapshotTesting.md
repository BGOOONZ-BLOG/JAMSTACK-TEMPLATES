Snapshot tests are a very useful tool whenever you want to make sure your UI
does not change unexpectedly.

A typical snapshot test case for a mobile app renders a UI component, takes a
screenshot, then compares it to a reference image stored alongside the test. The
test will fail if the two images do not match: either the change is unexpected,
or the screenshot needs to be updated to the new version of the UI component.

## Snapshot Testing with Jest

A similar approach can be taken when it comes to testing your React components.
Instead of rendering the graphical UI, which would require building the entire
app, you can use a test renderer to quickly generate a serializable value for
your React tree. Consider this
[example test](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/examples/snapshot/__tests__/link.react.test.js)
for a simple
[Link component](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/examples/snapshot/Link.react.js):

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Link from '../Link.react';
import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';

it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer
    .create(<Link page="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</Link>)
    .toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

The first time this test is run, Jest creates a
[snapshot file](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/examples/snapshot/__tests__/__snapshots__/link.react.test.js.snap)
that looks like this:

```javascript
exports[`renders correctly 1`] = `
<a
  className="normal"
  href="http://www.facebook.com"
  onMouseEnter={[Function]}
  onMouseLeave={[Function]}
>
  Facebook
</a>
`;
```

The snapshot artifact should be committed alongside code changes, and reviewed
as part of your code review process. Jest uses
[pretty-format](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/packages/pretty-format)
to make snapshots human-readable during code review. On subsequent test runs
Jest will simply compare the rendered output with the previous snapshot. If they
match, the test will pass. If they don't match, either the test runner found a
bug in your code that should be fixed, or the implementation has changed and the
snapshot needs to be updated.

More information on how snapshot testing works and why we built it can be found
on the
[release blog post](https://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html).
We recommend reading
[this blog post](http://benmccormick.org/2016/09/19/testing-with-jest-snapshots-first-impressions/)
to get a good sense of when you should use snapshot testing. We also recommend
watching this
[egghead video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-use-jest-s-snapshot-testing-feature?pl=testing-javascript-with-jest-a36c4074)
on Snapshot Testing with Jest.

### Updating Snapshots

It's straightforward to spot when a snapshot test fails after a bug has been
introduced. When that happens, go ahead and fix the issue and make sure your
snapshot tests are passing again. Now, let's talk about the case when a snapshot
test is failing due to an intentional implementation change.

One such situation can arise if we intentionally change the address the Link
component in our example is pointing to.

```javascript
// Updated test case with a Link to a different address
it('renders correctly', () => {
  const tree = renderer
    .create(<Link page="http://www.instagram.com">Instagram</Link>)
    .toJSON();
  expect(tree).toMatchSnapshot();
});
```

In that case, Jest will print this output:

![](/jest/img/content/failedSnapshotTest.png)

Since we just updated our component to point to a different address, it's
reasonable to expect changes in the snapshot for this component. Our snapshot
test case is failing because the snapshot for our updated component no longer
matches the snapshot artifact for this test case.

To resolve this, we will need to update our snapshot artifacts. You can run Jest
with a flag that will tell it to re-generate snapshots:

```bash
jest --updateSnapshot
```

Go ahead and accept the changes by running the above command. You may also use
the equivalent single-character `-u` flag to re-generate snapshots if you
prefer. This will re-generate snapshot artifacts for all failing snapshot tests.
If we had any additional failing snapshot tests due to an unintentional bug, we
would need to fix the bug before re-generating snapshots to avoid recording
snapshots of the buggy behavior.

If you'd like to limit which snapshot test cases get re-generated, you can pass
an additional `--testNamePattern` flag to re-record snapshots only for those
tests that match the pattern.

You can try out this functionality by cloning the
[snapshot example](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tree/master/examples/snapshot),
modifying the `Link` component, and running Jest.

### Interactive Snapshot Mode

Failed snapshots can also be updated interactively in watch mode:

![](/jest/img/content/interactiveSnapshot.png)

Once you enter Interactive Snapshot Mode, Jest will step you through the failed
snapshots one test suite at a time and give you the opportunity to review the
failed output.

From here you can choose to update that snapshot or skip to the next:

![](/jest/img/content/interactiveSnapshotUpdate.gif)

### Tests Should Be Deterministic

Your tests should be deterministic. That is, running the same tests multiple
times on a component that has not changed should produce the same results every
time. You're responsible for making sure your generated snapshots do not include
platform specific or other non-deterministic data.

For example, if you have a
[Clock](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/examples/snapshot/Clock.react.js)
component that uses `Date.now()`, the snapshot generated from this component
will be different every time the test case is run. In this case we can
[mock the Date.now() method](MockFunctions.md) to return a consistent value
every time the test is run:

```js
Date.now = jest.fn(() => 1482363367071);
```

Now, every time the snapshot test case runs, `Date.now()` will return
`1482363367071` consistently. This will result in the same snapshot being
generated for this component regardless of when the test is run.

### Snapshots are not written automatically on Continuous Integration systems (CI)

As of Jest 20, snapshots in Jest are not automatically written when Jest is run
in a CI system without explicitly passing `--updateSnapshot`. It is expected
that all snapshots are part of the code that is run on CI and since new
snapshots automatically pass, they should not pass a test run on a CI system. It
is recommended to always commit all snapshots and to keep them in version
control.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should snapshot files be committed?

Yes, all snapshot files should be committed alongside the modules they are
covering and their tests. They should be considered as part of a test, similar
to the value of any other assertion in Jest. In fact, snapshots represent the
state of the source modules at any given point in time. In this way, when the
source modules are modified, Jest can tell what changed from the previous
version. It can also provide a lot of additional context during code review in
which reviewers can study your changes better.

### Does snapshot testing only work with React components?

[React](TutorialReact.md) and [React Native](TutorialReactNative.md) components
are a good use case for snapshot testing. However, snapshots can capture any
serializable value and should be used anytime the goal is testing whether the
output is correct. The Jest repository contains many examples of testing the
output of Jest itself, the output of Jest's assertion library as well as log
messages from various parts of the Jest codebase. See an example of
[snapshotting CLI output](https://github.com/facebook/jest/blob/master/integration-tests/__tests__/console.test.js)
in the Jest repo.

### What's the difference between snapshot testing and visual regression testing?

Snapshot testing and visual regression testing are two distinct ways of testing
UIs, and they serve different purposes. Visual regression testing tools take
screenshots of web pages and compare the resulting images pixel by pixel. With
Snapshot testing values are serialized, stored within text files and compared
using a diff algorithm. There are different trade-offs to consider and we listed
the reasons why snapshot testing was built in the
[Jest blog](http://facebook.github.io/jest/blog/2016/07/27/jest-14.html#why-snapshot-testing).

### Does snapshot testing substitute unit testing?

Snapshot testing is only one of more than 20 assertions that ship with Jest. The
aim of snapshot testing is not to replace existing unit tests, but providing
additional value and making testing painless. In some scenarios, snapshot
testing can potentially remove the need for unit testing for a particular set of
functionalities (e.g. React components), but they can work together as well.

### What is the performance of snapshot testing regarding speed and size of the generated files?

Jest has been rewritten with performance in mind, and snapshot testing is not an
exception. Since snapshots are stored within text files, this way of testing is
fast and reliable. Jest generates a new file for each test file that invokes the
`toMatchSnapshot` matcher. The size of the snapshots is pretty small: For
reference, the size of all snapshot files in the Jest codebase itself is less
than 300 KB.

### How do I resolve conflicts within snapshot files?

Snapshot files must always represent the current state of the modules they are
covering. Therefore, if you are merging two branches and encounter a conflict in
the snapshot files, you can either resolve the conflict manually or to update
the snapshot file by running Jest and inspecting the result.

### Is it possible to apply test-driven development principles with snapshot testing?

Although it is possible to write snapshot files manually, that is usually not
approachable. Snapshots help figuring out whether the output of the modules
covered by tests is changed, rather than giving guidance to design the code in
the first place.

### Does code coverage work with snapshots testing?

Yes, just like with any other test.
