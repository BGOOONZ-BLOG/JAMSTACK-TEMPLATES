Ember allows us to create solutions we couldn't come up with years ago.

# Pain in the ass user :)

Welcome to the world of making things for people.

## Mental models

Understand where the user is coming from.

So, what are they?:

* What I think a thing is.
* How I think a thing works.

Ever evolving, can be updated and changed.

What is "home"? It's more than a kitchen sink or couch. There are characteristics
like a roof, windows, door, etc. This concept evolved over time.

Types of mental models:

* Macro: From a distance, initial assessment
* Micro: How the individual interaction works

Tinder example:

The communication model on iOS was taken from texting to their messaging. It's a model
that already exists. Designing to utilize these models creates a framework of understanding.
Thus increasing usability, with a clear path for learning.

But, don't copy.

Use mental models explicitly if they exist. However, sometimes it's worthwhile to break them (iPod).

### Thinning out spinners

Provide a skeleton UI for content to follow. Makes an app feel faster than a spinner. Feels like
something is happening, things are moving, stay tuned.

### Carry context

Connect the experience between devices.

> Can be a major save.

## Micro > Macro

Core interactions become a symbol of your app. Example: Threes, iOS thumbprint scanner.

### Offline mode "Goliath mode"

Disallow editing?: __No__.

#### Responding optimistically

Allow you to interact without internet access. Queues up the actions to be done later.

Can cause issues.
