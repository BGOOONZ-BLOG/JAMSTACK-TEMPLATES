}

The purpose of this page is to guide you through
all the potential restrictions that might be
enforced upon the content you have uploaded to Now.

## Blocked Deployments

There are two scenarios in which one or multiple
of your deployments might be blocked automatically. If
you have encountered one of them, please take immediate
action to avoid losing your data.

Once your deployment has been blocked, all
of its underlying data and resources
will still be safely stored. However, if you do not
take any action within 3 months, your deployment
and any associated metadata will be removed from our platform.

### Failed Payments

In the cases in which our system isn't able to charge
your given payment method in the specified cycle (see
our [Pricing](/pricing) page), we
will notify you about why the payment
failed and how you can fix it.

This means that you'll receive a few emails containing
details about how to update your billing information
and why you couldn't be charged. The last email
will be especially outstanding in terms of attracting
your attention.

In the case that you don't react to any of those
emails, your subscription and
associated resources will be suspended and you'll
receive another email containing exactly that information
and what you can do to activate
your subscription again.

At this point, if you haven't taken any action, you
won't be able to access any of Now's features
anymore ([more details](#how-deployments-are-blocked)).

To prevent this from happening, please ensure
that your specified payment method is always ready to be
charged.

In addition to that, it would also be beneficial
to ensure that emails from our platform
don't end up in your spam folder or get filtered out
as junk (they're being sent by an address ending with `@zeit.co`).

### Deployed under a Higher Plan

If you **downgraded** the plan of your personal account or
team, the deployments that were created under the previous
plan will be blocked.

This also works vice-versa: If you **upgraded** the plan of
your personal account or team, our system will ensure
that deployments created on any of the lower plans will
be unblocked accordingly.

In turn, you can **unblock your deployment** by either upgrading
to a plan that is equal to or higher than the one under which
the deployment was created, or re-deploying it.

### How Deployments Are Blocked

In both cases, these restrictions will be enforced upon
your deployment:

- Deployments will return the status code `402` and
a page letting you know about the failed payment. This message
can be seen by anyone trying to access the deployment.

- In addition to returning the error message, deployments
will be scaled to 0 running instances. No code will
be executed anymore.

In the case that your account or team was suspended because of
failed payments, the following will apply as well:

- API requests with the `Accept header` header
set to `application/json` will result in a JSON response
with the `error.code` property set to `payment_required`.

If you need additional advice on how to unblock your
deployments or prevent them from initially getting
blocked, please contact us at [support@zeit.co](mailto:support@zeit.co).
