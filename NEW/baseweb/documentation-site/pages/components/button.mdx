# Button

<Yard placeholderHeight={52} {...buttonYardConfig} />

Buttons provide cues for actions and events. These fundamental components allow users to process actions or navigate an experience.

## When to use

When a person:

- submits a form,
- starts a new task / action.

The Button component has 4 different `kind` variants: `primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`, and `minimal`.

**Primary** buttons are intended to be used as the leading trigger or cue of action. Primary buttons are
bold with a dominant color background and white text/icons. These are to be used sparingly as the
sole action of a view. Primary buttons can be accompanied by secondary button to balance action hierarchy.

**Secondary** buttons should be used in combination with a primary button as a way to create action hierarchy.
Secondary buttons are subdued in value with the primary color text to compliment the primary buttons.

**Tertiary** buttons can used as a substitute for a secondary buttons, but should never take the role of a
primary button action. As the name implies, itâ€™s offered to supplement to create variation within an experience.
