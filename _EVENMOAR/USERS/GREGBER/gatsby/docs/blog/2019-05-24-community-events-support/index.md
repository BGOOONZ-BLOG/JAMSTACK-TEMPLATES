Announcing [support for Gatsby Meetups](/contributing/organize-a-gatsby-event/)! There are tons of Gatsby meetups and events that are being organized by the community worldwide and it’s impressive to hear about the gatherings and how people enjoy connecting in person about Gatsby and the future of the web. We want to show more love for these events, so we’re launching a program that supports community organized meetups, events, and lunch and learns. Check out the new [Gatsby Community Events Page](/contributing/events/) to see all the meetups submitted so far!

## What constitutes a Gatsby event?

A community organized Gatsby event can be a local meetup, a small conference, a lunch and learn with coworkers, or a larger event. It’s up to you how many people you want to invite and how casual the environment. You can organize an event at your workplace or for the local community.

## What support does Gatsby provide?

There are several ways Gatsby may support your event:

- Promote event on the [Gatsbyjs.org Events Page](/contributing/events/)
- Promote event via [Gatsby’s Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs)
- \$300 off food related expenses
- Free Gatsby stickers from the [Gatsby Store](https://store.gatsbyjs.org/)
- 20% off swag in the [Gatsby Store](https://store.gatsbyjs.org/) for your attendees

If you’re interested in organizing a Gatsby event, [apply for support here](https://airtable.com/shrpwc99yogJm9sfI) and if you meet a few basic requirements, then you can qualify for Gatsby swag, \$300 for food, learning resources, and more. Get started by [submitting your request](https://airtable.com/shrpwc99yogJm9sfI) or learn more about the [program here](/contributing/organize-a-gatsby-event/).

Let us know what Gatsby events you’re planning!
