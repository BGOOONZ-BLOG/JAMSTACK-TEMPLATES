title: Deploying to Vercel
---

[Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) is a cloud platform for websites and serverless APIs, that you can use to deploy your Gatsby projects to your personal domain (or a free `.vercel.app` suffixed URL).

This guide will show you how to get started in a few quick steps:

## Step 1: Installing Vercel CLI

To install their command-line interface with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), run the following command:

```shell
npm i -g vercel
```

## Step 2: Deploying

You can deploy your application by running the following command in the root of the project directory:

```shell
vercel
```

That's all!

Your site will now deploy, and you will receive a link similar to the following: https://gatsby-functions.now-examples.now.sh
