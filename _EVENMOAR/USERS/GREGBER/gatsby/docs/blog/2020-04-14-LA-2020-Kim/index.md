_Welcome to the Gatsby Days 2020 Video Blog: Los Angeles Edition. In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the wit and wisdom shared at the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you werenâ€™t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool for sure, joining us at our next Gatsby Daysâ€”currently scheduled as a virtual event June 2nd-3rdâ€”would be pretty awesome, too ðŸ’œ. Follow [Gatsby on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) to keep up with when registration starts, speaker announcements and other developments)._

Daniel Kim is a masterâ€™s degree student at the University of California, Davis, and the founder of [Bit Project](https://www.bitproject.org/)â€”a student organization that strives to make technical education accessible to more people. With over 70 developer members, Bit Project has reached more than 3,100 students. The group is working to expand its community through technical workshops, coding bootcamps, and outreach programs.

Daniel and his team recently decided to launch a new five-week course to teach beginning web development. They considered using React as the basis for the course but found that the extreme customization available with React made it tough for teaching. Instead, they chose Gatsby. Watch Danielâ€™s presentation from Gatsby Days LA 2020 and learn why hot reloading, routing, themes, and other capabilities made Gatsby the right choice. Then hear how Daniel used Gatsby in each week of the course to teach key web development concepts.
