exports[`FakeTimers runAllTimers warns when trying to advance timers while real timers are used 1`] = `
"A function to advance timers was called but the timers API is not mocked with fake timers. Call \`jest.useFakeTimers()\` in this test or enable fake timers globally by setting \`\\"timers\\": \\"fake\\"\` in the configuration file. This warning is likely a result of a default configuration change in Jest 15.
