# Purpose

The button-group now only supports one 'kind' value (tertiary). 'kind' is no longer an available prop
on the `ButtonGroup` component. Alternate kinds had coloring issues where users were unable to distinguish
between the focused and selected states when operating as a radio group.

## ButtonGroup

```diff
- <ButtonGroup kind="primary" />
+ <ButtonGroup  />
```
