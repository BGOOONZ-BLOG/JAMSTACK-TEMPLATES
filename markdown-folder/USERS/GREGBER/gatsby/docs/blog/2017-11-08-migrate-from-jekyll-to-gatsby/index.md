## A bit of history

Some years ago I created my [blog](https://blog.singuerinc.com/) with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it has been working well ever since.

I have never been a huge fan of Ruby, but because of requirements or convenience
I’ve built apps with it (Rails / Sinatra / Jekyll / etc).

I used to like Jekyll because I could write my posts in Markdown which is super
easy to write and edit.. When I started my blog, I took a theme called
[Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) and tweaked it a bit. That was
enough for me.

But recently I find that I only install Ruby and Jekyll to manage my blog (I
mostly develop with Node). I tried to develop my blog inside a Docker container,
but this was extremely slow.

Some weeks ago, one of my colleagues at work told me about
[Gatsby](/) Since I was already learning
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and had started looking at
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) (after attending a talk at
[Nordic.js](http://nordicjs.com/))—I was very interested in giving it a try.

## Migrating from Jekyll to Gatsby

### Data

One of the biggest concern about migrating from one generator to another is how
you move the data. In my case, I have around 45 posts so it is not a big deal to
convert from one type to another, but still manual work that I wanted to avoid.

Luckily Gatsby works with Markdown and it can take the data from your YAML front
matter block, so you don't have to change anything. You just need to install
`gatsby-transformer-remark` plugin.

Then, in your `gatsby-config.js` file add:

```js
plugins: ["gatsby-transformer-remark"]
```

### Theme

My blog is clean and simple, I don't need too much CSS. Instead of bloating my
blog with a theme I added [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/). I managed to
replicate 99% of my previous theme with classes from Tachyons. Something that I
would like to do better is to remove the parts of Tachyons that I’m not using.

[My current CSS file](https://github.com/singuerinc/blog/blob/master/src/layouts/index.css) has less than 30 lines. The rest of the layout is created
with tachyons classes.

### Slug + Date

This was the only "tricky" part, since I wanted to preserve the same page names
in order to make a 1:1 transition. This was not possible with the default
behavior from Gatsby. I don't have a `date` field in my front matter block, so I
need to extract the date from the file name.

The slug in my case is generated with this (default in Jekyll) structure:

```text
https://blog.singuerinc.com/[n-categories]/YYYY/MM/DD/dashed-title/

// Given this data:
categories:
  - app
  - macos
  - vuejs
  - electron

filename: 2017-05-09-introducing-tomeito.md

// I would like to get:
/app/macos/vuejs/electron/2017/05/09/introducing-tomeito/
```

How did I create it? Inside my `gatsby-node.js` I used the `onCreateNode`
extension API to tweak the slug:

```js
exports.onCreateNode = ({ node, getNode, boundActionCreators }) => {
  const { createNodeField } = boundActionCreators

  if (node.internal.type === `MarkdownRemark`) {
    const { categories } = node.frontmatter

    const filename = createFilePath({ node, getNode, basePath: `pages` })

    // get the date and title from the file name
    const [, date, title] = filename.match(
      /^\/([\d]{4}-[\d]{2}-[\d]{2})-{1}(.+)\/$/
    )

    // create a new slug concatenating everything
    const slug = `/${slugify(
      categories.concat([date]).join("-"),
      "/"
    )}/${title}/`

    createNodeField({ node, name: `slug`, value: slug })

    // save the date for later use
    createNodeField({ node, name: `date`, value: date })
  }
}
```

### Deploy

I used to deploy to [GitLab Pages](https://about.gitlab.com/features/pages/),
but I noticed that from time to time it’d go down, so I’m now testing
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which has almost the same CI workflow:

## Conclusions

Some key points:

- Node instead of Ruby
- Much faster development workflow e.g. hot reload out of the box
- I can query the data I need and transform it before using it. (I'm looking
  into the [`gatsby-plugin-feed`](/packages/gatsby-plugin-feed/) to recreate the
  Atom Feed)
- React and GraphQL for free with Gatsby
- Since I am confident with the Node ecosystem I'm able to contribute: [First
  pull request to Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/2569)
- Netlify vs GitLab Pages (hopefully 100% uptime)

## Final thoughts

Although the blog is the same, in content and look, the way that is created has
completely changed. For me it is a whole new experience—easier, and faster.

I wanted to move the blog to Node a long time ago and it is finally there!

Next is to convert [my portfolio](https://www.singuerinc.com/) (also built with Jekyll).

## Show me the code

If you want to take a look at [the code](https://github.com/singuerinc/blog) you can do it, it is published in GitHub.
