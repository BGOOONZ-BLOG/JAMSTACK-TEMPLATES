# using-page-transitions

Gatsby example site using page transitions.

This example uses `react-transition-group` in conjunction with `gatsby-plugin-layout`. For more complex page transitions and no `gatsby-plugin-layout` dependency, you can make use of [`react-pose`](https://github.com/Popmotion/popmotion/tree/master/packages/react-pose).
