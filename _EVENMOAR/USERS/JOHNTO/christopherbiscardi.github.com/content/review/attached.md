## Why should you read it?

If you don't know about Attachment Theory and want an overview in
about 300 pages.

## What did I get out of it?

I learned a bit about attachment theory and how it can be used to
model relationships. It's probably not perfect (I haven't known about
it for that long at this point) but does provide some useful
heuristics when thinking about why people act the way they do. It also
provides some good information about how to counteract habits and
behaviors that have built up over time that you might not be happy
with.
