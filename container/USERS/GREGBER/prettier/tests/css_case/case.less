// Convention in this test file:
// - The case should be preserved for things prefixed with "Keep".
// - The case should always be preserved for element names and attribute names
//   in selectors, as well as function names and property keywords.
// - Other things should mostly be lowercase.
// - The `/*:*/` comments are just to bust the `isLikelySCSS` check.
