# Internationalization

Base Web publishes a language translation utility called `LocaleProvider` so that strings required
to display components can be configured to best support website visitors from non-English speaking
locations. Please note that some factors of internationalization are not taken care of here; this
includes pluralization, currency, and list formatting. If you need that support, take a look at the
[Intl](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) API
Date and time formatting are customized with
[date-fns internationalization tools](https://date-fns.org/v2.15.0/docs/I18n).

Below is an example of how to use the `LocaleProvider`. This component should generally wrap the
application and must be provided with a dictionary of terms translated to the appropriate language.
It is up to developers to handle state management and language switching based on their site
requirements. In this particular example, we are customizing labels in the pagination component
into Hungarian. 'next' becomes 'Következő' and 'prev' becomes 'Előző'. Fill out other terms in
the locale if your application requires it.

The next example shows how to leverage the `date-fns` internationalization helpers. View their
[documentation](https://date-fns.org/v2.15.0/docs/I18n) for additional information. It also
customizes the `formatString` to display the chosen date in a familar format to the target location.
View the date-fns [format documentation](https://date-fns.org/v2.8.1/docs/format) for how to use
this feature.
