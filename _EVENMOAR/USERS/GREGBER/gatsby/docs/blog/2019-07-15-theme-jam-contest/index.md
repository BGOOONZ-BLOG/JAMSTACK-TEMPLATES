To celebrate the [stable release of Gatsby Themes](/blog/2019-07-03-announcing-stable-release-gatsby-themes/), we launched the Gatsby Theme Jam contest. To enter the contest, create your own Gatsby Theme and submit it to the [Theme Jam website](https://themejam.gatsbyjs.org/) by July 31st, 2019. Everyone who enters the contest will get a limited-edition Gatsby Theme Jam mug or t-shirt, and **two winners will be selected to win a trip to the Gatsby Days event of their choosing**.

## What are Gatsby Themes?

Gatsby Themes are pre-built, installable packages for setting up a site’s default styling, components, plugins, and overall configuration that can be reused across multiple Gatsby sites. They’re a great way to simplify the early steps of configuring a new site; and, when it’s time to update your site’s styling or functionality, you only have to edit your theme or swap it out entirely with another compatible theme. You can find a more detailed explanation in the [Themes section of Gatsby’s documentation](/docs/themes/).

If you’d like to see an example, check out Gatsby’s official [blog theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog) or [notes theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-notes).

## How to build your Gatsby theme

If you’re planning to build a theme for the contest, you may want to start with this [Gatsby Theme Jam Submission Example repository](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-jam-example). You can build a child theme of an existing Gatsby theme (e.g. the [blog theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-blog) or [notes theme](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-theme-notes)) with updated styling or added functionality, for example, or it can be a completely new theme.

Here are some resources with detailed instructions on how to build a Gatsby theme:

- [“Building Themes” - Gatsby Documentation](/docs/themes/building-themes/)
- [“Gatsby Theme Authoring” - free course on Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring)
- [“Building your first Gatsby theme (with Emma Wedekind)” - Learn with Jason](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2uTfay3doo)

## How to enter the Theme Jam Contest

To enter the Theme Jam Contest, you will need to…

1. Review your theme against the [Theme Jam Submission Checklist](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-jam-example/blob/master/theme/README.md#submission-checklist).
2. Complete and submit your entry through the [Theme Jam Contest Submission form](https://airtable.com/shrqRYknYY50YCzeq) by **Wednesday, July 31st at 11:59pm Pacific time**. Your Theme Jam submission will need to include links to its repository on GitHub, the npm package, and a demo site.

Submissions will be judged on a range of criteria including code quality and legibility, accessibility, performance, documentation, and creativity.
