# Using WordPress With Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)

https://using-wordpress.gatsbyjs.org/

Example site that extends the [using-wordpress](examples/using-wordpress/) example and demonstrates how to build Gatsby sites that pull data from the
[WordPress CMS API](https://www.wordpress.com/) using Advanced Custom Fields.

IMPORTANT NOTE: This example site won't keep working if you switch the WordPress site to one of yours. It's meant as a learning resource. Try starting from scratch with a site created by `gatsby new` and start copying over parts from this site starting with `gatsby-config.js`.
