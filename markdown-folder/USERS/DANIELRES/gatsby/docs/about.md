# About Gatsby

Transform plain text into dynamic blogs and websites using the latest
web technologies. A React.js static site generator.

Supports Markdown, HTML, and React.js pages out of the box. Easy to add
support for additional file types.

Leverages React's [component model](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html)
 and [React Router's "nested component hierarchy"](https://github.com/rackt/react-router/blob/master/docs/Introduction.md)
to make templating incredibly powerful and intuitive.

All templates, css, and content are *hot reloadable* — powered by
[webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).

Build sites like it's 1995. Files are translated into HTML pages at the
same position within the file system. Add a markdown file at `/docs/index.md` and
it'll be converted to `/docs/index.html`.

## Warning!
Gatsby is not yet stable. APIs will break. Functionality is missing. It's
usable but if you plan on building with it, expect a rocky road for some time.

*[We've started work on a 1.0 release of Gatsby!](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/419)*

Contributions welcome!

## Goals
* No-reload page transitions
* Hot reload editing. Tweak your pages, templates, and styles and see changes in
  real time.
* Make React.js component model and ecosystem available for building static sites
* Intuitive directory-based URLs. The URL of a page is derived from its
  spot on the file system.
* Support "Starters" — install starter sites directly from Github. Use open sourced
  starters or build your own.

## Why use Gatsby instead of other Static Site Generators
* No-refresh page transitions
* The awesome React.js component model
* Live editing on every part of your site. Dramatically speed development.

## I'm already building a server-rendered React.js site, is Gatsby a good fit?
If your site falls closer to the site end of the app<---->site spectrum
then yes.

Gatsby is an excellent fit for blogs, marketing sites, docs sites, etc. Proper web
apps should probably remain as normal web apps (though I'd love to be
proved wrong!).
