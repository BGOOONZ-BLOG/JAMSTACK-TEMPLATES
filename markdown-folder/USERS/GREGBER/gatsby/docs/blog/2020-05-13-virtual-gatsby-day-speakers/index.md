From driving directions to the spread of a pandemic, maps are a tool that can have a great impact on everyone's lives. But building a map with some data doesn't have to be hard.

If you've got a hand in the air, don't miss Derek Murr's talk about his experience of going from coding bootcamp to a job helping a small team to build an all-new website from scratch using Gatsby.

You'll learn how the combination of Gatsby's documentation, the speed with which you can get a new site up and running, the breadth of plugins, and the enthusiasm of the community all made it a great environment for him as a new developer -- and how it can help you to jump in and start building!
