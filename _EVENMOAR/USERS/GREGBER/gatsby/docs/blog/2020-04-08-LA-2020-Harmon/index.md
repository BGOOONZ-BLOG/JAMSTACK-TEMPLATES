_Welcome to the Gatsby Days 2020 Video Blog: Los Angeles Edition. In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the wit and wisdom shared at the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you werenâ€™t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool for sure, joining us at our next Gatsby Daysâ€”currently scheduled as a virtual event June 2nd-3rdâ€”would be pretty awesome, too ðŸ’œ. Follow [Gatsby on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) to keep up with when registration starts, speaker announcements and other developments)._

Speed is everything in e-commerce. A single extra second of load time can cost an online retailer 7% in lost sales every year. To keep customers engaged and revenues flowing, you need to ensure your site is fast.

Trevor Harmon is a front-end web developer at Shopify who is passionate about using technology to solve real-world challengesâ€”particularly the challenge of launching successful e-commerce websites. To be successful, these sites need to be _fast_.

Watch Trevorâ€™s presentation to learn how harness Shopify and Gatsby together to produce blazing-fast e-commerce sites. Trevor provides a detailed, step-by-step walkthrough for setting up a sample site, showing how to set up a Shopify store, pull data into Gatsby, use that data to create pages, and implement a Shopify plugin to manage checkout.
