# Pin Code

<Yard placeholderHeight={48} {...pinYardConfig} />

The `PinCode` component is optimized for entering sequences of digits.
The most common application is for entering single-use security codes.
It is optimized for entering digits quickly.

## Examples

<Example title="Basic usage" path="pin-code/basic.js">
  <PinCodeBasic />
</Example>

Each input collects one digit at a time.
When a digit is entered, focus transfers to the next input in the sequence, until every input is filled in.
A few things to note:

1. You canʼt enter anything other than a digit.
2. You can only enter one character per input.
3. To overwrite the value of an input, you donʼt need to select the text in the input. If you type a digit while the input is focused, the input will update. This is an optimization for quickly editing the inputs.
4. Pressing `Delete` when there is nothing in the input will transfer focus to, and clear the value of, the previous input (if any). This avoids the need to explicitly Shift+Tab & Delete.

<Example title="Code length" path="pin-code/length.js">
  <PinCodeLength />
</Example>

`PinCode` expects an array of strings for the `values` prop.
The number of inputs rendered will match the length of the array.

<Example title="Passing id and name" path="pin-code/id-and-name.js">
  <PinCodeIdAndName />
</Example>

You can pass an individual `id` or `name` prop.
`name` will be shared amongst the inputs, meaning they will each have their `name` set to this value.
`id` will have an index appended to whatever string you provide and passed to the respective input.
In the above example, the resulting ids are `foo-0`, `foo-1`, `foo-2`, and `foo-3` and each input has the name `pin-code`.

<Example title="States" path="pin-code/states.js">
  <PinCodeStates />
</Example>

`PinCode` accepts most of the same boolean props as our other inputs: `disabled`, `error`, `positive`, etc.

<Example title="Sizes" path="pin-code/size.js">
  <PinCodeSizes />
</Example>

You can control the size of the inputs with the `size` prop.

<Example title="Changing the placeholder" path="pin-code/placeholder.js">
  <PinCodePlaceholder />
</Example>

If you donʼt like the default placeholder (`○`), you can change that too.
Notice how each placeholder disappears when any of the inputs have focus.

<Example title="Adding mask" path="pin-code/mask.js">
  <PinCodeMask />
</Example>

You can add a default mask (`.`) by setting `mask=true`.
Prop `mask` also accepts `string` input as customized mask style. For example, you can get an asterisk mask by setting `mask='*'`.

<Example title="Disable focus management" path="pin-code/no-tab.js">
  <PinCodeNoTab />
</Example>

You can disable `PinCode`ʼs built-in focusing logic by toggling the `manageFocus` prop.
It defaults to `true`, which makes it so that when an input receives a digit, focus is automatically changed to the next input.
It also transfers focus to a previous input when `Delete` is pressed with focus on an empty input.
Set `manageFocus` to `false` if, for some reason, you donʼt want this nifty behavior.
You can use the `onChange` handler to implement your own thing.

<Example title="The main Event" path="pin-code/event.js">
  <PinCodeEvent />
</Example>

The object passed to `onChange` has two properties.
`values` is the new array of strings that `PinCode` thinks you should update your state with.
Of course, you can decide not to use those values.
If, for some reason, you do not want to use `values`, the `onChange` object also includes an `event` property which references the original input change event.

We do not envision a lot of scenarios where you would need this level of control- but just in case, it is there for you.
Note, if you do decide to go off the rails with `event`, you may want to turn off `manageFocus` as well.
Otherwise you may have focus jumping around in ways inconsistent with your customizations.

<Example title="Autofocus" path="pin-code/autofocus.js">
  <PinCodeAutofocus />
</Example>

There is a decent chance that if you are using `PinCode` you want it to be focused from the start.
Simply set `autoFocus` to `true` to focus the first input upon initial mounting of the component.

In the example above, click `Mount PinCode` to ...mount the PinCode component.
With `autoFocus` toggled on, the first input receives focus immediately.

<Example title="Once things are filled in" path="pin-code/completion.js">
  <PinCodeCompletion />
</Example>

It is a common pattern to immediately submit the userʼs input once the full pin code has been entered.
In the above example, we shift focus to the submit button once all of our inputs have been filled in.
Keep in mind that folks may have mistyped a digit so auto-submitting might be a bit aggressive.

<Example title="Autocomplete and Copy + Paste" path="pin-code/basic.js">
  <PinCodeBasic />
</Example>

Try copying & pasting `1234` into any of the inputs in the example above.

By default, you can only change one input at a time.
But what if a user wants to copy and paste a value in?
Or what if the userʼs browser can [autocomplete verification codes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/password_autofill/enabling_password_autofill_on_an_html_input_element#3001194).

If one of the individual inputs receives a longer string, `PinCode` does some basic validation (is the length right? does it contain only digits?) to see if it can fill all the inputs.
If things seem promising, `PinCode` will call `onChange` will all of the values updated.

<Example title="Stateful (uncontrolled) usage" path="pin-code/stateful.js">
  <PinCodeStateful />
</Example>

As with many of our components, there is also an [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) version, `StatefulPinCode`, which manages its own state. The default code length for this component is four, but you can change that by passing in an array of a different length to `initialState`.
