_After much thought and discussion, the Gatsby team has decided not to hold Virtual Gatsby Days in the way we originally planned. While we were very much looking forward to our first digital community gathering, we feel now is not the time to take attention and space away from the Black Lives Matter movement._

_Transforming Gatsby Days from a live event into a content series keeps the focus on more important events while sharing the amazing speakers and learning opportunities in a way the community can access when the time is right for each of us. All of the product and program announcements planned for Gatsby Days have been rolled up into [an initial blog post](/blog/2020-06-23-Reconfiguring-Gatsby-Days/), and now we are following with a video series to present the speakers who had been scheduled to share their knowledge during the event. We hope you enjoy._ ðŸ’œ

_We look forward to seeing you at our next Gatsby Days, planned for October, though itâ€™s difficult to say right now exactly what form that will take. Follow [Gatsby on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) to keep up with announcements around our fall Gatsby Days planning, calls for proposals, when registration starts, and other developments._

Maps come in many forms, but they almost always help make data more meaningful -- and mapping apps are easier to build than you might think. Colby Fayock, Lead UX and Front End Engineer at Element 84, shows how to quickly build compelling map apps using [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) and Gatsby. To make the process even faster and even easier, Colby helped create a [Gatsby Recipe](/docs/recipes/) to automatically add React Leaflet to a project, as well as a Gatsby starter and theme. Along the way, Colby explains how mapping apps can be just like any other JAMstack app, with JavaScript and data from APIs compiled down into markup that can be deployed on several different services.
