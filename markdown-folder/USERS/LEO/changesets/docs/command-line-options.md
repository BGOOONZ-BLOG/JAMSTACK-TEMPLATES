# Command line options

The command line for changesets is the main way of interracting with it. There are 4 main commands. If you are looking for how we recommend you setup and manage changesets with the commands, check out our [intro to using changesets](./intro-to-changesets.md)

- init
- add [--empty]
- version [--ignore, --snapshot]
- publish [--otp=code, --tag]
- status [--since-master --verbose --output=JSON_FILE.json]
- pre [exit|enter {tag}]

The most important commands are `add`, which is used by contributors to add information about their changes, `version` - which is responsible for using the changesets generated by `add` to update package versions and changelogs, and then `publish` which publishes changes to npm.

## `init`

```
changeset init
```

This command sets up the .changeset folder. It generates a readme and a config file. The config file includes the default options, as well as comments on what these options represent. You should run this command once, when you are setting up changesets.

## `add`

```
changeset add
```

or just

```
changeset
```

This is the main command people use to interact with the changesets.

This command will ask you a series of questions, first about what packages you want to release, then what semver bump type for each package, then it will ask for a summary of the entire changeset. At the final step it will show the changeset it will generate, and confirm that you want to add it.

Once confirmed, the changeset will be write a Markdown file that contains the summary and YAML front matter which stores the packages that will be released and the semver bump types for them.

A changeset that major bumps @changesets/cli would look like this:

```
---
"@changesets/cli": major
---

A description of the major changes.
If you want to modify this file after it's generated, that's completely fine or if you want to write changeset files yourself, that's also fine.
```

--empty - allows you to create an empty changeset if no packages are being bumped, usually only required if you have CI that blocks merges without a changeset.

```
changeset --empty
```

A changeset created with the empty flag would look like this:

```
---
---
```

If you set the commit option in the config, the command will add the updated changeset files and then commit them.

## version

```
changeset version
```

This is one of two commands responsible for releasing packages. The version command takes changesets that have been made and updates versions and dependencies of packages, as well as writing changelogs. It is responsible for all file changes to versions before publishing to npm occurs.

> We recommend making sure changes made from this commmand are merged back into master before you run publish.

Version has two options, `ignore` and `snapshot`:

```
changeset version --ignore PACKAGE_NAME
```

This command is used to allow you to skip packages from being published. This allows you to run partial publishes of the repository. Using ignore has some safety rails:

1. If the package is mentioned in a changeset that also includes a package that is not ignored, publishing will fail.
2. If the package requires one of its dependencies to be updated as part of a publish.

These restrictions exist to ensure your repository or published code do not end up in a broken state. For a more detailed intricacies of publishing, check out our guide on [problems publishing in monorepos](./problems-publishing-in-monorepos).

```
changeset version --snapshot
```

Snapshot is used for a special kind of publishing for testing - it creates temporary versions with a tag, instead of updating versions from the current semver ranges. You should not use this without [reading the documentation on snapshot releases]('./snapshot-releases.md')

## publish

```
changeset publish [--otp={token}]
```

This publishes changes to npm, and creates git tags. This works by going into each package, checking if the version it has in its `package.json` is published on npm, and if it is not, running the `npm publish`.

Because this command assumes that last commit is the release commit you should not commit any changes between calling version and publish. These commands are separate to enable you to check if the releases changes are acurate.

`--otp={token}` - allows you to provide an npm one-time password if you have auth and writes enabled on npm. The CLI also prompts for the OTP if it's not provided with the --otp option.

`--tag TAGNAME` - for packages that are published, the chosen tag will be used instead of `latest`, allowing you to publish changes intended for testing and validation, not main consumption. This will most likely be used with [snapshot releases]('./snapshot-releases.md').

### Git Tags

It is useful to have git tags of a publish, to allow people looking for the code at that time to find them. We generate tags in git during publish, but you will need to push them back up if you want to make them available. We recomend after publish you run:

```
git push --follow-tags
```

## status

```
status [--verbose] [--output={filePath}] [--since={gitTag}]
```

The status command provides information about the changesets that currently exist. If there are no changesets present, it exits with an error status code.

- `--verbose` - use if you want to know the new versions, and get a link to the relevant changeset summary.

- `--output` - allows you to write the json object of the status out, for consumption by other tools, such as CI.

- `--since` - to only display information about changesets since a specific branch or git tag (such as `main`, or the git hash of latest). While this can be used to add a CI check for changesets, we recommend not doing this. We instead recommend using the [changeset bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) to detect pull requests missing changesets, as not all pull requests need one if you are on github.

## pre

```
pre [exit|enter {tag}]
```

The pre command enters and exits pre mode. The command does not do any actual versioning, when doing a prerelease, you should run changeset pre enter next(or a different tag, the tag is what is in versions and is the npm dist tag) and then do the normal release process with changeset version and changeset publish. For more information about the pre command, see the prereleases [the prereleases documentation](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets/blob/master/docs/prereleases.md).

> NOTE: pre-releases are a very complicated feature. Many of the safety rails that changesets helps you with will be taken off. We recommend that you have read both [problems publishing in monorepos](./problems-publishing-in-monorepos) as well as be clear on both exiting and entereing pre-releases before using it. You may also prefer using [snapshot releases](./snapshot-releases.md) for a slightly less involved process.
