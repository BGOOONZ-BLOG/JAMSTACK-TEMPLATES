# Get the Base Components

The first thing you'll have to do is to head over the Uber Figma Community and create a clone of the Base Gallery.

<Button $as="a" href="https://www.figma.com/@uber" target="_blank">
  Go to Figma Community
</Button>

Click on the "Base Gallery", and hit "Duplicate" so you can get your copy of the Base Gallery. As the file is rather big, this may take a while.

Once the duplication is done, you'll be presented with an instance gallery of all the components that you can duplicate to drafts or publish as a team library if you have a professional team account. For now, the library itself is not published.

# About Figma Communities

Figma Community enables design teams to share their work, and others to re-use them. You can learn more about it in the [official announcement](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/).
