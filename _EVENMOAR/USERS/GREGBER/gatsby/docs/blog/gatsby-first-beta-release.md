We shipped today Gatsby's first beta for 1.0! Gatsby is a modern blazing-fast
static site generator for React.js.

Ten months and one day ago
[I announced I was now working full-time on Gatsby](https://www.bricolage.io/gatsby-open-source-work/)
followed a month later by posting
[an issue kickstarting the rewrite of Gatsby for a 1.0 release](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/419)

Since then, 40 contributors have pushed 723 commits contributing to 23 alpha
releases before today's first beta release. It's been a really enjoyable
experience watching Gatsby v1 take form and helping shape that and the growing
community around it.

## What's part of v1

From Gatsby's initial release just over two years ago, Gatsby has let you build
static websites using React.js components as well as markdown, JSON, and YAML.

Building on this strong foundation, v1 adds:

- New plugin architecture (to date 45+ plugins have been written)
- New data layer which lets you integrate data from both remote (CMSs, APIs,
  etc.) and local sources
- Progressive web app features such as automatic code and data splitting (by
  route), prefetching, and service worker and offline-first support

## Special thanks to

Getting to this point wouldn't have happened without the help of many
individuals and companies.
