I'm pretty devoted to making the web a better place: This means considering all users on all devices. This means showing empathy. This means lightweight, responsive websites that are mobile first.\nI love leveraging build tools and automating every process I can. I enjoy experimenting with new technology and incorporating it into my workflow when appropriate. I <3 open source and find great value in metrics, especially in terms of website performance.\nI also like skiing and soccer. A lot.","education":[{"university":"Boise State University","degree":"Bachelor of Science in Computer Science","completed":"May 2015","city":"Boise","state":"Idaho"},{"university":"Montana State University","degree":"Bachelor of Arts in Hispanic Studies","completed":"May 2010","city":"Bozeman","state":"Montana"}],"projects":{"featured":[{"name":"Random A11y","description":"Vote on random, accessible color combinations","url":"http://randoma11y.com","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/random-a11y"},{"name":"Tachyons","description":"Functional CSS for humans.","url":"http://tachyons.io","github_url":"https://github.com/tachyons-css"},{"name":"CSS Stats","description":"Webapp and node utilities to visualize various stats about your css.","url":"http://cssstats.com","github_url":"https://github.com/cssstats"},{"name":"Pixyll","description":"A simple, beautiful Jekyll theme that is mobile first.","url":"http://pixyll.com","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll"},{"name":"Immutable CSS","description":"A linter for immutable CSS.","url":"https://github.com/johnotander/immutable-css","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/immutable-css"},{"name":"Furtive","description":"A forward-thinking, lightweight, CSS microframework.","url":"http://furtive.co","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/furtive"},{"name":"Scrutinize","description":"Scrutinize a url by analyzing CSS, HTML, accessibility, images, pagespeed, etc.","url":"https://github.com/johnotander/scrutinize","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/scrutinize"},{"name":"Ember Gravatar","description":"An Ember component for gravatar image tags.","url":"http://ember-cli-gravatar.divshot.io","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/ember-cli-gravatar"},{"name":"Grayscale","description":"A grayscale color palette for prototyping the web.","url":"http://www.g-r-a-y-s-c-a-l-e.com/","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/gray"},{"name":"Urls for Humans","description":"Apply persistent, meaningful urls to your Rails app.","url":"https://github.com/johnotander/urls_for_humans","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/urls_for_humans"},{"name":"Deleted","description":"A safer delete experience.","url":"http://johnotander.com/deleted/","github_url":"https://github.com/johnotander/deleted"},{"name":"Markdown CSS","description":"A collection of CSS modules to make Markdown, or raw HTML, look beautiful.","url":"http://markdowncss.github.io/","github_url":"https://github.com/markdowncss"}]}}
