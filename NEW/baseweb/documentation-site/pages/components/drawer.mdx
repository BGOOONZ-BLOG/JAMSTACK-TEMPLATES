## Accessibility

We have built in functionality based on the recommendations for dialogs and drawers in [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#dialog_drawer).

- Upon opening, focus will be transferred to the first interactive element (unless `autofocus` is set to false)
- Container element has `aria-label="drawer"`
- `Escape` key closes the drawer
- Click on backdrop (anywhere outside dialog) hides drawer.
- Background is not be scrollable while drawer is open (position: fixed).
- Upon closing, focus should return to element that triggered drawer.
