# Tokens

You can import Base Web design tokens from `baseui/tokens`. A primitive token is just an alias for a value in your design system, such as a hex or pixel value. It creates a consistent way to reference an immutable value in a design system. For example:

```js
const acmeBlue = '#0000FF';
```

Anytime someone needs to reference the blue for Acme Co. there is a single place it is defined and exported. Note, this is a little different from a theme, which assigns semantic meaning to colors. A token is just a consistent way to reference an immutable value in a design system.

Currently we only export `colors` from `baseui/tokens`. In the future, we may add more types of values to the module such as typography and spacing values. Eventually we may even move tokens into a separate package entirely- to better support other platforms and keep `baseui` focused on components.

Not every color listed in tokens is used in a `baseui` component. This is simply the complete set of official Base Web colors. Ideally these are the only colors you would need to use in a Base Web project.

## Usage

So what do you do with a token? Should you import it wherever you need to use the color? Should you alias it in your theme object?

You could employ either of those strategies. However, we think the best way to use tokens with `baseui` is to assign them to your theme's properties.

You can create a custom theme with your choice of color tokens. Here is what that might look like:

```js
// myTheme.js

import {createTheme, lightThemePrimitives} from 'baseui';
import {colors} from 'baseui/tokens';

const myThemePrimitives = {
  ...lightThemePrimitives,
  primary: colors.blue400,
  primary50: colors.blue50,
  primary100: colors.blue100,
  primary200: colors.blue200,
  primary300: colors.blue300,
  primary400: colors.blue400,
  primary500: colors.blue500,
  primary600: colors.blue600,
  primary700: colors.blue700,
};

const myTheme = createTheme(myThemePrimitives, {});

export default myTheme;
```

You could also assign primitive color tokens as overrides on the theme if there is a specific theme property that needs further customization.
Sometimes our default mapping of theme's building primitives to theme properties may differ from your own intentions.

```js
// myTheme.js

import {createTheme, lightThemePrimitives} from 'baseui';
import {colors} from 'baseui/tokens';

const myThemeOverrides = {
  colors: {
    borderFocus: colors.yellow200,
  },
};

const myTheme = createTheme(lightThemePrimitives, myThemeOverrides);

export default myTheme;
```

It is best to assign things at the theme's building primitives level, with overrides as a backup.
When you assign tokens directly in component code or alias them on the theme object you
are opting out of the `baseui` way of doing things. We will try to support those use
cases the best we can, but our priority will always be supporting theme primitives and
overrides first.

For more on `baseui` theming check out [the documentation](/guides/theming).

## Primitive Color Tokens

<ColorPreviewContainer>
  {Object.entries(TokensExports.colors).map(([name, value]) => {
    return <ColorPreview name={name} value={value} displayValue={value} />;
  })}
</ColorPreviewContainer>

Not every color listed here is used in a `baseui` component. This is simply the complete set of official Base Web colors. Ideally these are the only colors you would need to use in a Base Web project.
