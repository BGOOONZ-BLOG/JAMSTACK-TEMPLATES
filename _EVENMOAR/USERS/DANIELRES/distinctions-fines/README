== Distinctions Fines blog engine

Hi, this is my blog engine made from ground up using Rails 3.1, for my upcoming personal blog.

Concepts and values of this project:

- Minimalism, simplicity, use of standard gems (devise, omniauth, compass, bluecloth, ...) to build most parts of the app.
- Observing the Rails conventions at all circumstances.
- Easy authentication for users through Facebook, Twitter and others.
- Reducing th amount of code typing to adapt the blog to your needs: using HAML, COMPASS, SASS, ...

Feel free to fork it, use it and improve it if you like it !
