## New Features
The new source plugin for WordPress gives you the following enhanced developer and content editor experience:

- Preview content as you write it with Gatsby Preview
- Update or publish new content almost instantly with Incremental Builds, available only on Gatsby Cloud
- Links and images within the HTML of content can be used with [gatsby-image](/docs/gatsby-image/) and [gatsby-link](/docs/gatsby-link/). This fixes a common complaint about the original source plugin for WordPress.
- Limit the number of nodes fetched during development, so you can rapidly make changes to your site while creating new pages and features
- Only images that are referenced in published content are processed by Gatsby, so a large media library won’t slow down your build times 
- Any WPGraphQL extension automatically makes its data available to your Gatsby project. This means your site can leverage popular WordPress [SEO](https://github.com/ashhitch/wp-graphql-yoast-seo), [content modeling](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/extensions/wpgraphql-advanced-custom-fields/), [translation](https://github.com/valu-digital/wp-graphql-polylang), and [ecommerce](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/extensions/wpgraphql-woocommerce/) plugins through a single Gatsby source plugin.

## How to start using the new WordPress source plugin
Follow the steps below to bring Gatsby Preview and Incremental Builds to your Gatsby/WordPress project:

1. Get the source plugin and its dependencies from the Gatsby repository: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-source-wordpress-experimental

2. Add [WPGraphQL](https://docs.wpgraphql.com/getting-started/install-and-activate/) and [WPGatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/wp-gatsby) to your WordPress installation. These two free WordPress plugins will turn your site into a GraphQL server, and enable Gatsby Preview. 

3. Build your project with [Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/get-started/), and enjoy [near instant](https://willit.build/details/type/blog/source/wordpress/page-count/512) content publishing speeds. Please see the full [Gatsby Cloud + WordPress documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/wordpress/getting-started/) for more details.
