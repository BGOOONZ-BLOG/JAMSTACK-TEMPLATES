## Challenge 15: Encapsulate and Share Your Work with a Gatsby Theme

This week you'll learn how to create a Gatsby Theme! Themes are a neat way to wrap your site development work into a package that can be used by others on your team, or the open source community.

The resources below will help you to create your first theme, and learn from themes that the Gatsby community has published.

### Gatsby Theme Creation Resources

Start with this free [video course on authoring Gatsby Themes](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring). While you watch the videos, use this [written Gatsby Theme guide](/tutorial/building-a-theme/), which is meant as a companion to the course.

For inspiration, investigate the repos of the projects [that were showcased during Theme Jam](https://themejam.gatsbyjs.org/showcase), our hackathon for Gatsby Themes.

### What to Do If You Need Help

If you get stuck during the challenge, you can ask for help from the [Gatsby community](/contributing/community/) and the [AskGatsbyJS](https://twitter.com/AskGatsbyJS) Twitter account. You can find fellow Gatsby Developers on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/gatsby), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gatsbyjs/), [Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/gatsby-js), and [Dev](https://dev.to/t/gatsby).
