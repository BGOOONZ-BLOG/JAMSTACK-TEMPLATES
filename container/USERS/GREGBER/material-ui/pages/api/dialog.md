# Dialog

Dialogs are overlaid modal paper based components with a backdrop.

## Props

You may specify a single timeout for all transitions, or individually with an object. |

Any other properties supplied will be [spread to the root element](/guides/api#spread).

## CSS API

You can override all the class names injected by Material-UI thanks to the `classes` property.
This property accepts the following keys:
- `root`
- `paper`
- `paperWidthXs`
- `paperWidthSm`
- `paperWidthMd`
- `fullWidth`
- `fullScreen`

Have a look at [overriding with classes](/customization/overrides#overriding-with-classes) section
and the [implementation of the component](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tree/v1-beta/src/Dialog/Dialog.js)
for more detail.

If using the `overrides` key of the theme as documented
[here](/customization/themes#customizing-all-instances-of-a-component-type),
you need to use the following style sheet name: `MuiDialog`.

## Inheritance

The properties of the [&lt;Modal /&gt;](/api/modal) component are also available.
