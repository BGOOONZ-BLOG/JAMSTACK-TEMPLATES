_Welcome to the Gatsby Days 2020 Video Blog: Los Angeles Edition. In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the wit and wisdom shared at the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you werenâ€™t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool for sure, joining us at our next Gatsby Daysâ€”currently scheduled as a virtual event June 2nd-3rdâ€”would be pretty awesome, too ðŸ’œ. Follow [Gatsby on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) to keep up with when registration starts, speaker announcements and other developments)._

Kathleen McMahon is a senior front-end software engineer and the tech lead for Oâ€™Reilly Mediaâ€™s Design System team. Recently, her team decided it was time to rework the design systemâ€™s component library documentation. The primary goals: encourage more contributions by making the documentation process more user friendly and improve accessibility so more users could take advantage of the resulting documentation.

Her teamâ€™s solution was to incorporate Gatsby with MDX into the documentation tooling. Learn how Kathleenâ€™s team implemented these technologies and discover ways to customize your own implementation using several Gatsby plugins. Hear how the Design System team Oâ€™Reilly Media has been able to reduce barriers for contributions, minimize documentation maintenance burdens, and make the documentation area more inclusive.
