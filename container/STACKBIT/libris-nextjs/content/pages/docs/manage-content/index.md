<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This is the demo content for demonstration purpose only. The primary function of this content is to show you what this theme can do. There is a more detailed explanation in the <strong>Getting Started</strong> section.
</div>

## Code Blocks

Blocks of code are either fenced by `lines with three back-ticks`, or are indented with four spaces.

<pre>
```
body {
  background: #fff;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.66667; }

a {
  color: #d4a259;
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease; }

a:hover {
  color: #1d1d1d;
  text-decoration: none; }
```
</pre>

The rendered output looks like this:

```
body {
  background: #fff;
  color: #666;
  line-height: 1.66667; }

a {
  color: #d4a259;
  text-decoration: underline;
  -webkit-transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease; }

a:hover {
  color: #1d1d1d;
  text-decoration: none; }
```

## Callouts

There are two types of callouts available in this theme, **note** and **important**. To add a callout to your documentation simply add the following `html` code with class `important` or `note`. Like in the example bellow.

### HTML example

Copy the code and modify these blocks according to your needs.

```
<div class="important">
  <strong>Important:</strong> 
  This is an "Important" callout block of text.
  This block indicates a warning or caution. 
  Use it for an important message. 
</div>
```

```
<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> 
  This is a "Note" callout block of text. 
  This block signifies a general note.
</div>
```

### Live example

<div class="important">
  <strong>Important:</strong> 
  This is an "Important" callout block of text. 
  This block indicates a warning or caution.
  Use it for an important message. 
</div>

<div class="note">
  <strong>Note:</strong> 
  This is a "Note" callout block of text. 
  This block signifies a general note.
</div>

## Tables

You can build tables with markdown to help you organize information. To add a table, use three or more hyphens (---) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes (|) to separate each column like in the example below.

| Title | Title |
| ------| ----- |
| Text  | Text  |
| Text  | Text  |
