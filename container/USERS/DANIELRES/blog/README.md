# gatsby-amp-starter-blog

A gatsby starter for creating an AMP compliant blog.

Not sure what Amp is? Learn about [Project AMP](https://www.ampproject.org).

## Running in development
`npm run develop`

## Building for production

To create a production build, run `npm run build`

The build will output to the `public` directory and that directory will contain an `amp` directory which has the amp version of your site.

You can then spin up a web server using MAMP or your tool of choice locally that points to your public directory. And test that your site is AMP compliant using this [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amp-validator/nmoffdblmcmgeicmolmhobpoocbbmknc?hl=en)
