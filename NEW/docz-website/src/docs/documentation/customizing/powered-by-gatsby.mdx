# Powered by Gatsby

[Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) is a blazing fast modern site generator for React and one of the greatest modern tools
of the new frontend era. It has a huge ecosystem and community around it and a very concise team behind.

The Docz core since the new v2 is entirely build around Gatsby, this is the biggest change
in the project since its creation and one of the best things that we could make for the tool.

Using Gatsby as bundler behind the scenes we won a lot of benefits like:

* Stay focused in create features instead of lead with bundler management
* Static and optimized builds by default
* Fast dev-experience and better workflow
* Huge ecosystem of tools, plugins and community
* Better and easy way to customize things inside Docz
* More power in order to create your documentation

## Gatsby API and Hooks

Gatsby has a pretty damn good [API for developers](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/api-reference/) and a lot of hooks and life cycle methods that you can use in order to customize the process of
your bundle. Indeed you can hook into it in a lot of ways and all these hooks
and properties you can use with Docz.

So, if you want to use any of those Gatsby configurations file inside your Docz project, create it in the root and we'll handle them for you.

If you want to make some change in the webpack configuration, you can use
the `onCreateWebpackConfig` hook inside the `gatsby-node.js` file:

```js
// gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateWebpackConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setWebpackConfig({
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: 'my-css',
          use: [loaders.style(), loaders.css()]
        },
      ],
    },
  })
}
```

Or if you want to change your Babel configuration you can use `onCreateBabelConfig` hook for this:

```js
// gatsby-node.js
exports.onCreateBabelConfig = ({ actions }) => {
  actions.setBabelPlugin({
    name:  `babel-plugin-emotion`,
    options: {
      sourceMap: true,
    },
  })
}
```

Indeed you have a lot of hooks and actions that you can use to modify or get some information about your bundler process.
