# The Perceptron neural net
A neural net from scratch to help you understand the maths behind neural networks ! make sure to read the medium article I've written !

You will find in the repo a jupyter notebook of one perceptron made from scratch & one with sklearn dependency

Also an Iris flowers classifier that you can train using a real data from Kaggle !

## dependencies used on the perceptron from scratch

Numpy

Matplotlibv

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

## dependencies used on the perceptron using scikit-learn
Numpy

Matplotlibv

Jupyter Notebook

scikit-learn


## Install dependencies

	pip install numpy
  
	pip install matplotlib
  
	pip install jupyter
  
 	pip install -U scikit-learn
  
	pip install pandas
