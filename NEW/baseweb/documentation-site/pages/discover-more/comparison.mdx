# How Base Web compares with other component libraries

We understand that before start using a component library and invest
time to learn it, you want to better understand how it is designed
and what constraints you'll have to work with. On this page,
we'd like to provide you with this information.

## Technical overview

The table below shows you a high-level comparison of the most popular
React component libraries and Base Web. While we try to do our best
to keep it up-to-date, it may have incorrect information. If you
notice that, please let us know in a GitHub issue, or send a Pull Request fixing it!

<Table
  columns={['Name', 'CSS Engine', 'Customization']}
  data={[
    [
      'Base Web',
      'CSS-in-JS, using Styletron',
      'Through an extensive overrides interface',
    ],
    ['Material-UI', 'CSS-in-JS, using JSS', 'Through CSS overrides'],
    ['Ant Design', 'Less', 'Through Less variables'],
    [
      'React Bootstrap',
      'SCSS, inherited from Bootstrap',
      'Through Bootstrap themes',
    ],
    ['Semantic UI', 'Less', 'Through Less variables'],
  ]}
/>

## Governance

Base Web is a project created and maintained by the UI and Design Platform
teams at Uber. Because of this, most of the components will address the
requirements of internal Uber applications. While we may consider implementing
missing components, we cannot guarantee that your proposals will ever land.

In this sense, we are similar to Material-UI, where the design language
is governed by Google.
