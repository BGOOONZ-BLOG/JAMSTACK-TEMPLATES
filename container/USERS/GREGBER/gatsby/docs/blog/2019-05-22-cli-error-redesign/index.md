## How did this project come about?

The CLI is the main entry point and interface people have (currently) for Gatsby. Everyone sees it! So it has a huge influence on people’s experience of Gatsby.

We conducted 4 usability tests with awesome Gatsby users to learn how they do tasks using the Gatsby CLI and how they use error messages to debug their projects. Thanks [Simon Koelewijn](https://github.com/smnk), [Gene Smith](https://twitter.com/gene_r_smith), [Jonathan Prozzi](https://github.com/jonathanprozzi), and [Benjamin Lannon](https://github.com/lannonbr) for teaching us how you use the CLI, and thanks to [@sidharthachatterjee](https://github.com/sidharthachatterjee), [@wardpeet](https://github.com/wardpeet), [@pieh](https://github.com/pieh), [@m-allanson](https://github.com/m-allanson), [@gillkyle](https://github.com/gillkyle) for copiloting the interviews with me and helping turn what we learned into action.

## What did we learn?

Our error messages aren't always helpful; sometimes they are even absent! They don't comply with best practices suggested by the research we did.

We did a thorough search of other CLIs and style guides to learn what we're doing well and where we might be falling short. Here are resources that informed our knowledge of problems that Gatsby CLI has and possible ways to solve those problems:

- [Evaluation of other CLI tools](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/12951)
- [Nielsen Norman Group 10 usability heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)
- [Nielsen Norman Group error message design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-message-guidelines/)
- [Heroku CLI style guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cli-style-guide)
- [12 Factor CLI Apps](https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46)
- [User journey through the Gatsby CLI](https://whimsical.co/2PxMcRGE63bwk1Ayc3emAB) (informed by usability interviews and the Gatsby core team’s observations of what issues are most common regarding the CLI)

## What do we need to do next?

To optimize the CLI design, we’ll use the data being collected through our telemetry setup, which collects data about CLI usage (opt out is possible).

1. Crunch some numbers to find out what the most common error messages are that people get
2. Make error messages better, starting with the most common ones
3. Create a CLI style guide and make sure the CLI starts matching the style guide
4. Do some other things that will make the CLI easier to use (easier = takes less time to do a task and/or is less frustrating). See [issues tagged with `topic: cli`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22topic%3A+cli%22) in the OSS repo!

## Want to dive in and help / comment?

The first step is to get consensus on the [Error Survey RFC](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs/pull/37) & [CLI Redesign RFCs](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/rfcs/pull/38) and start on the changes they suggest.

All issues related to those RFCs will be [tagged with `topic: cli`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22topic%3A+cli%22) in the OSS repo.

List of issues (some already have PRs in progress):

- [with `gatsby new`, users have options to select one of three default starters or visit the starter library](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/14085)
- [Redirect and/or accept multiple options for localhost addresses](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/14084)
- [Clear screen to show only relevant information after `gatsby develop` in the CLI](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/13513)
