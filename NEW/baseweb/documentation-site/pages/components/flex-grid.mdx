# FlexGrid

Many layouts we build today are well-suited for the [`grid`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid) CSS property, e.g. lining things up into rows or columns with specified gap sizes. Unfortunately, there is [limited support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid) in Internet Explorer today, so it is not recommended to use for certain sets of customer applications.

**FlexGrid** aims to provide a grid-like component for these customer applications, using [`flexbox`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) to lay equal-width items in a row, and wrapping as needed to form a grid. It also supports specifying row or column gaps that only appear between items, and can adapt columns or gaps responsively to different screen widths.

Note: **FlexGrid** must contain **FlexGridItem** components as children in order to get the desired behavior with widths and margins. Also note that these are both implemented using **Block**, and can take all the **Block** properties for styling.

## Examples

<Example title="FlexGrid basic usage" path="flex-grid/basic.js">
  <Basic />
</Example>

<Example
  title="FlexGrid unequal (narrow) widths"
  path="flex-grid/unequal-narrow.js"
>
  <UnequalNarrow />
</Example>

It is possible to achieve unequal-width items using **Block** style overrides.

<Example
  title="FlexGrid unequal (wide) widths"
  path="flex-grid/unequal-wide.js"
>
  <UnequalWide />
</Example>

Also, keep in mind that the margins won’t be set properly unless you have the correct number of items in each row. In this example, we add a hidden element after the wide element so that the last item in the first row has a margin-right of zero.

<Example title="FlexGrid missing items" path="flex-grid/missing.js">
  <Missing />
</Example>

**FlexGrid** will add additional margin after the last element such that it always lines up with the row above, and avoids `flexbox`’s default nature of spreading out.

## Responsive Layouts

**FlexGrid**, like **Block**, accepts props as either a single value or an array of values. See [Block](/components/block) for more details.

<Example title="FlexGrid responsive usage" path="flex-grid/responsive.js">
  <Responsive />
</Example>
