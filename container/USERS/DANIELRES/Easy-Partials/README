Easy Partials is a bit of code that I published from my blog at:

http://smellsblue.blogspot.com/2009/11/easy-partials-in-rails.html

You are free to fork this and modify it to your hearts content,
though I would appreciate attribution if you publish it. If you
need a license, then consider it under the same license Rails uses.
If you would like to see this feature built in to Rails, by all
means pass on the idea to someone influential on the Rails team!
