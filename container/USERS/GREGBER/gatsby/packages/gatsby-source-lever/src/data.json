We understand recruiting like no other company - we’ve had countless hours of user research and conversations to learn about the joys and challenges of recruiters, who are too often undervalued and under-appreciated.

We’re talking really aggressive. You know the typical portfolio of recruiter (reviewing resumes, phone screens, coordinating interviews, and managing offers). This time though, you’ll be in a place where everyone from top to bottom, across all teams, take hiring seriously. The whole team will fully support you and more than ever, you’ll have more agency to drive and create hiring initiatives the way you envision it.  \n\nAnd if you’re interested, help us build a community around Lever’s user base of recruiting professionals – organize events, run meetups, attend conferences – and step up to be a visible, public member of our team.  \n\nIn terms of what we’re looking for, past tenure at a hyper-growth startup is ideal. You should be data-driven and passionate about constant improvement, with a “whatever it takes to get it done” attitude. Hopefully you consider yourself a competitive person - the top talent you’re working with will be, and you’ll be fighting other companies for them! Most important of all is understanding of people: perspectives/motivation of candidates and ability to connect people to right opportunities, as well as using your people skills to partner with hiring managers in meeting growth goals.\n",
