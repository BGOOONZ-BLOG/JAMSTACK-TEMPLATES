_Welcome to the Gatsby Days 2020 Video Blog: Los Angeles Edition. In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the wit and wisdom shared at the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you werenâ€™t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool for sure, joining us at our next Gatsby Daysâ€”currently scheduled as a virtual event June 2nd-3rdâ€”would be pretty awesome, too ðŸ’œ. Follow [Gatsby on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) to keep up with when registration starts, speaker announcements and other developments)._

Zac Gordon is a community builder at [Strattic](https://www.strattic.com/) the serverless WordPress host Strattic and an educator who has taught courses on building with JavaScript and Gatsby in WordPress for high schools, colleges, bootcamps, and online learning sites. He is particularly excited to discuss ways the evolving [content mesh](/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/) is pushing WordPress and the web forward by enabling developers to capitalize on best-of-breed microservices.

At Gatsby Days LA 2020, Zac explored developer options for building highly dynamic, rich WordPress sites. First focusing on ways to incorporate comments into sites, Zac examined native, custom coding, and SaaS approaches. Learn the pros and cons of each option and discover what similar options exist for implementing additional dynamic elements, including forms, memberships, and e-commerce capabilities to websites.
