# Toast

<Yard placeholderHeight={52} {...toastYardConfig} />

Toasts can be dismissed and sit on top of a view in various position options - top/right, top/center,
top/left, bottom/right, bottom/center, bottom/left. Toasts are intended to provide feedback to a user
and self-dismiss after a short time with an option to self-dismiss. Each toast can be colored to fit
itâ€™s status type of neutral, positive, warning and alert.

**Using the `toaster` utility:**

Toasts can be created easily with some of the helper functions on `toaster`, as seen in the code sample above. If a key isn't provided, it will auto-generate a unique key for you which will be returned in the instantiation functions (`info, positive, warning, negative`).
If a toast with an identical key already exists, that toast's contents will be updated instead of a new toast being created. The autoHide timeout will reset unless the `resetAutoHideTimerOnUpdate` prop is set to false on the toaster.

## Accessibility

- Toast notification container element has `role="alert"` set on it.
- When multiple alerts are displayed and positioned relative to the browser window they won't overlap but displayed in a column way, latest notifications are displayed at the initial position of a chosen placement.
- By default, `autoHideDuration` is set to `0`, which means a Toast will remain until dismissed by the user. If possible, try setting an `autoHideDuration` that makes sense for the content of the Toast. The `autoHideDuration` countdown will be paused when a user focuses or hovers over the Toast. The countdown will be reset once the user unfocuses or moves their mouse off of the Toast.
- Do not put important actions in Toasts. If you must put an action in a Toast, do not set an `autoHideDuration`.
- You can force focus to the dismiss button when a Toast mounts with the `autoFocus` prop (on both `Toast` and `Toaster`). Use this with caution and keep in mind that screenreaders may read the Toast's content twice (due to the focus shift and alert role).
