_Welcome to the Gatsby Days 2020 Video Blog: Los Angeles Edition. In this series of eleven videos, you can catch up with all the wit and wisdom shared at the presentations from our February community gathering in LA. If you werenâ€™t able to make it in person, these videos are the next best thing to owning a time machine! (Though owning a time machine would be super cool for sure, joining us at our next Gatsby Daysâ€”currently scheduled as a virtual event June 2nd-3rdâ€”would be pretty awesome, too ðŸ’œ. Follow [Gatsby on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs) to keep up with when registration starts, speaker announcements and other developments)._

Developers are adept at coding engaging, high-performance websites and web applications. Unfortunately, dev-driven sites are often difficult for content creators to update and manage.

On the flip side, content management systems like WordPress simplify life for content creators but blunt the ability for developers to use the advanced tools they know and love. Gatsby software engineer Josh Comeau asks whether there is a way to deliver great end-user experiences while satisfying both developers and content creators. _(Spoiler alert: The answer is Gatsby)_.

Learn how using Gatsby in conjunction with a headless CMS can help you build user-friendly and developer-friendly websites while giving content creators a front end they can navigate without technical expertise. Josh highlights the value of using a content mesh approach in assembling best-of-breed capabilities. And he demonstrates the benefits of Gatsby Preview for content creators to view their changes in real time as they add text, insert images, and even modify site-wide navigation.
