# Using WordPress

This is an example which contains sample code for demonstrating how to source data from WordPress using the [gatsby-source-wordpress plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/). This example is created to serve as an extension to the example code provided in the [Sourcing from WordPress recipe](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/recipes/sourcing-data#sourcing-from-wordpress) in the Sourcing data section. It is meant for the purpose of learning and contains code that cannot be included in the recipe itself.
