  ![Save action in Libre Office](libreoffice-save-psd.png)

Most of .psd files can be openend in Gimp, but sometimes some strange and cryptic errors make it impossible.



I tried a few other image viewers from the Ubuntu software center, without success.

Eventually, I tried LibreOffice (former OpenOffice) and it worked like a charm !


Just launch LibreOffice Writer, open file, choose your .psd file and here it is !

LibreOffice show your .psd as a  flat file, all layers merged together. Now just right click on the displayed image and choose "Save as image...". Now you can save your image as a .png file for example.

Another option would be to try [Faststone Image Viewer](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=3415), [Xnview](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=1927), [Acdsee](http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=299)... or [Photoshop](http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?appId=17) in Wine.
