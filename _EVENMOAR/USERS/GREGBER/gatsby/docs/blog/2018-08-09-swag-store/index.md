We‚Äôve spent the last couple weeks working the kinks out, and we couldn‚Äôt be happier with the response we‚Äôve seen.

## Free swag for all contributors üí™üíú

We‚Äôre extremely excited about the launch of the store because it means contributors are now able to get stickers, socks, and/or t-shirts for free ‚Äî a little token of our appreciation for putting the time in to make the open source community even better. You‚Äôre all amazing, and we üíú you for it.

Going forward, all contributors to the [Gatsby organization on GitHub][org] will automatically qualify for free Gatsby swag. **And when we say _all_ contributors, we mean it: even if you contributed to Gatsby before the store was launched, you‚Äôre qualified for free swag!**

For more details and instructions on how to claim your free swag, see [the ‚Äúswag for contributors‚Äù section of the docs][swag].

Here‚Äôs the short version:

1. Head to the [swag store][store]
2. Log in with your GitHub account at the top right of the page
3. Request a discount code with your name and email
4. Use that discount code at checkout to get one free item from the swag store!

> **NOTE:** The way this works is by checking that your GitHub account has at least one merged PR in the [Gatsby organization][org]. However, **contributing code is _not_ the only way to contribute to open source!** Check out [the ‚Äúhow to contribute‚Äù docs][contribute] for more examples of contributions that qualify for free swag. Email us at [team@gatsbyjs.com](mailto:team@gatsbyjs.com) if you‚Äôre a non-code contributor and want your free swag.

## Shipping is free on all orders globally

We know how much it sucks when things aren‚Äôt available in your country, so ‚Äî for now, at least ‚Äî Gatsby Inc. is footing the bill for shipping, no matter where you are in the world. It is our sincere hope that we can keep this up, but we can‚Äôt guarantee it‚Äôs sustainable. (_Hint: this means you should probably order sooner rather than later, just in case._)

## Post your swag photos on Twitter!

We love seeing how great the community looks in purple, so please post your Gatsby swag photos with the hashtag [#buildwithgatsby](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23buildwithgatsby).

## How the store works

All of the source code for the swag store [has been open sourced][swag-source]. The frontend is a [Gatsby v2][v2] site (naturally) using [Shopify][shopify] (and their [JS Buy SDK][js-buy-sdk]) to display products and manage carts, [Auth0][auth0] to handle authentication, and a [custom Express API][swag-api] to manage discount code requests.

We also use [Peril][peril] to [automatically invite contributors][invite] to the Gatsby organization on GitHub and post details about claiming swag. Here‚Äôs an example (and some kind words from Gatsby contributor [Payton Burdette](https://twitter.com/beardedpayton)) showing what the automated response looks like:

## What‚Äôs next?

We have a lot of ideas for the Gatsby store ‚Äî from [new swag ideas](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/store.gatsbyjs.org/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Swag+Ideas%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc) to adding more rewards for contributors who go above and beyond ‚Äî but we‚Äôd love to hear more from you! Please [tweet at us][twitter] or open issues on [the store repo][swag-source] with ideas.

For now, that‚Äôs it! We‚Äôll leave you with our favorite genre of tweet: ‚Äúdogs wearing Gatsby swag‚Äù.
