# Document settings

Document settings can be something simple, but powerful. They should be defined in the top of the `.mdx`
using yaml and can be used to change whatever you want by passing this config to your theme.

By default the document has **three** properties that can't be overriden:

```markdown
---
name: My Document
route: /custom-route
menu: Documents
---
```

- `name` Define the name of your component, the title of the page
- `route *(optional)*` Define the route of your component.

>If you don't pass any here, we'll create a slug getting the filepath of your file as route.

- `menu  *(optional)*` Group documents into a single menu by changing this prop.

## Custom properties

The built in properties are for docz but docz is exstensible and you can create your own themes where you could have different needs and need different properties. Custom properties can be set in the document settings and they will automatically be parsed.

For example you can define a property called `fullpage` to define whether your document is a page with `100%` width or not:
```
---
name: My Document
fullpage: true
---
```

When you later on are creating a theme these settings are passed to your theme components which you can read more about under [**Creating your themes: Using documents settings**](/docz/creating-your-themes#using-documents-settings)
