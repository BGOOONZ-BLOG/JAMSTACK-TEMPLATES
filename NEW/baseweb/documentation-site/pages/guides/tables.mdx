# Tables

Tables are used to display data organized in rows and columns. Base Web provides a couple different
table components that are appropriate in various situations.

You should generally default to using the [`table-semantic`](/components/table-semantic) version. This
component, which uses the standard `<table>` element, will have accessibility ready to go, supports
row/column spans, and will dynamically size column widths based on content. It will be most appropriate
when displaying a smaller number of rows or is paginated. It includes sorting and row selection features
as well.

<Example title="Table Semantic" path="table-semantic/basic.js">
  <TableSemantic />
</Example>

If you are rendering many rows, want to support infinite scrolling, or need data-analysis features like
filtering, sorting, and search you may be looking for the [`data-table`](/components/data-table) version.
This component does not support overrides like other Base Web components and requires data to align with
strict column schemas. Unlike other options it does not support cell/column spans or dynamic row heights.
Think of this as something closer to Excel rather than a standard table.

<Example title="Data Table" path="data-table/batch-action.js">
  <DataTable />
</Example>

Base Web publishes two additional tables that are not quite as useful as the above, but may be appropriate
in niche situtaions.

First is the [`table-grid`](/components/table-grid). This table ustilizes `css-grid`
for layout which some developers prefer over the semantic table element. It will require a custom
accessibility solution, but supports some alternative row/column spans.

<Example title="Table Grid" path="table-grid/cell-span.js">
  <TableGrid />
</Example>

Last is a div-based [`table`](/components/table). This is only recommended in situations where 'expanding
rows' is required and your application needs to support browsers without `css-grid`. If you are only
targeting newer browsers, `table-grid` is better, but even then it doesn't have great accessibility support.
Please have good reason to use these last two table components.

<Example title="Table" path="table/basic.js">
  <Table />
</Example>
