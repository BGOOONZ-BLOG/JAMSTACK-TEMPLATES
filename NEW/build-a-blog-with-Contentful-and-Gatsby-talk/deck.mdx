## What's Headless CMS?

---

Before I answer this question, let's see how "Traditional CMS" works

[Walt Disney Company](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/)

---

Now let's see an example of a website built with the JAMStack (Headless CMS + JavaScript)

[Waddle](https://www.waddle.com.au/)

---

But if data already exists and is not fetched at run time, then when does it get fetched?

---

import Box from './Box.js'
import GatsbyLogo from './images/gatsby.svg'

## Meet Gatsby js

<Box>
  <img src={GatsbyLogo} alt="Gatsby logo" />
</Box>

---

A modern web framework built with React, GraphQL and Webpack

It is known for it's great SSG feature which lets you do SSR (Server Side rendering) during build time

---

This lets us fetch content from Contentful during build time, create the pages for each content

---

> You can build dynamic apps with it and fetch content from Contentful using their API too

---

## Benefits?

<Steps>

- Blazing fast as it's a hydrated SPA (Single Page App)
- You could turn your website into a PWA in seconds and have content reachable offline
- SEO friendly as there exists an HTML page that can be crawled by web crawlers

</Steps>

---

> Modern web crawlers like Google's bot can actually crawl JavaScript, your SPA can be crawled now

---

## JAMStack, the what/why/how?

The Jamstack is not about specific technologies. Itâ€™s a new way of building websites and apps that delivers:

- better performance
- higher security
- lower cost of scaling
- and a better developer experience.

import ContentfulLogo from './images/contentful.png'

## Contentful - Distribute Content to any platform

<Box>
  <img style={{width: 256}} src={ContentfulLogo} alt="Contentful logo" />
</Box>

---

A modern CMS that acts like a content infrastructure which can be used as a headless CMS

---

## Time to build our JAMStack powered blog

## Thank you!

Feel free to ask me anything
