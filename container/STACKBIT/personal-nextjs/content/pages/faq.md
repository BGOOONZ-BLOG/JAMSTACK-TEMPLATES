      - title: What is your process?
        content: >-
          It's important to me to fully understand your business and what you're
          trying to achieve. I will start with an interview and follow up with a
          tailored questionnaire. Then, I produce writing samples to make sure
          we're on the right track. Once we work together, we can make as many
          revisions as you'd like so that your content is perfect.
      - title: Can you manage our social media?
        content: >-
          Of course! I am happy to manage Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook
          and any other social media platform you wish to maintain. This
          includes both posting relevant and interesting content, and replying
          to questions and comments from your audience.
      - title: How do you base your pricing?
        content: >-
          Depending on the scope and timeline of your content needs, we can work
          on a retainer basis, an hour bank, or a per-project basis. Once I
          understand your needs I will create a tailored proposal with several
          options to choose from.
      - title: What if my business is technical?
        content: >-
          No product or service is too technical to learn and understand. Part
          of our initial onboarding is an in-depth understanding of your
          offerings, your target audience and your level of technical writing
          needed.
      - title: How fast can we get started?
        content: >-
          The onboarding process typically lasts 3-4 days and consists of an
          intro video call, an interview, a questionnaire and some back and
          forth communication for technical purposes. After that, we can go as
          fast as you need.
      - title: Who handles the design?
        content: >-
          You can choose to provide the design yourself, or I can include a
          design element to your proposal. I work with several wonderful
          designers with ample experience in web, digital, campaign and
          marketing design.
