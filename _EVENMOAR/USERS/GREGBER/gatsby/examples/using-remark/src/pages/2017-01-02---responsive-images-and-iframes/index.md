[gatsby-remark-images][1] and [gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe][2] are here to
take care of all your basic Markdown image and iframe issues.

## Images

[gatsby-remark-images][1] provides _out-of-the-box progressive image loading_
(as popularized by [Medium][3] and [Facebook][4]) for all local JPGs and PNGs in
your Markdown documents.

You aren't just limited to markdown image tags either. You can either use
markdown image tags:

```
![](image.png)
```

Or HTML image tags:

```
&lt;img src="image.png" alt=""&gt;
```

### What about retina images?

Absolutely, these are supported too! Gatsby takes care to retain images' pixel
density.

### Okay, nice! But what about GIFs?

Sadly, [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) – the library that does the
actual image processing for us in [gatsby-plugin-sharp][5] – is not able to
write out the GIF file format. We will just copy them over for you, instead, and
also do that with SVGs.

An inline example ![example](squiggly.svg) SVG. Tremendous!

And here's an awesome SVG tiger:

## iFrames and video embeds

Let's add a YouTube video to show off responsive iFrames real quick:
