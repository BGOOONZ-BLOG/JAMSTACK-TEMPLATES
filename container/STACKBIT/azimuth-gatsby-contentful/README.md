## Quick Start üèé

[Create a site](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/azimuth-gatsby-contentful&utm_source=theme-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stackbit_themes) from this theme using Stackbit.

Stackbit will execute following steps for you

- Create a new GitHub repository with the contents of this repository.
- Create a new [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) project.
- Create [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) site connected to the GitHub repo
- Deploy the Netlify site.
- Create a Stackbit project that will allow you edit your website via on-page
  visual editing experience.

Additionally, Stackbit will connect all services together:

- Create a "commit" webhook in GitHub that will trigger Netlify deployment as
  soon as new commit is pushed to GitHub.
- Create a "publish" webhook in Contentful that will trigger Netlify deployment as
  soon as content is published in Contentful.


## Editing Content üìù

Once Stackbit creates a site, you can start editing the content using the free
on-page editing experience provided by the [Stackbit Studio](https://stackbit.com?utm_source=project-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=user_themes).

## Develop Locally

1. [Create a site](https://app.stackbit.com/create?theme=https://github.com/stackbit-themes/azimuth-gatsby-contentful&utm_source=theme-readme&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=stackbit_themes) from this theme using Stackbit.

1. Stackbit will create a new GitHub repository, a [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) project, and deploy the site via the selected serverless deployment platform (e.g., [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com)).

1. Once finished, you will be redirected to Stackbit Studio where you will be
   able to edit the content using the free on-page editing experience, and
   publish new versions of your site

1. To develop your site locally, clone the generated repository.

1. Install npm dependencies:

        npm install

1. Set the following environment variables locally.

   - `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID` - Contentful Space ID. You can acquire the space ID from Contentful's app URL: https://app.contentful.com/spaces/<SPACE_ID>.
   - `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Content Delivery API - access token. You can acquire from Contentful's app in API Key's section - "Settings" => "API Keys" => "Content delivery / preview tokens" => "Add API Key" or pick one Stackbit generated for you.

1. Start the Gatsby local development server (run from project root):

        npm run develop

1. Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) in the browser. You can now edit the site contents, and the browser will live-update your changes. üéâ


## Building for production üèó

To build a static site for production, run the following command

```shell
npm run build
```

The exported site will be written to the `public` folder. The contents of this folder
can be deployed by serverless deployment platform such as [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
