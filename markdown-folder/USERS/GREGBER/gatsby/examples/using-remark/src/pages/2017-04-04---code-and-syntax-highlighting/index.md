Code blocks are part of the Markdown spec, but syntax highlighting isn't.
However, many renderers support syntax highlighting. In
[gatsby-remark-prismjs][1], we use 🤔 [PrismJS][2].

## Inline code

```no-highlight
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

## Code blocks

In Markdown, blocks of code are either fenced by lines with three back-ticks
<code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code>, or are indented with four spaces. Fenced code
blocks are easier to write and maintain, and only they support syntax
highlighting by indicating a language.

To see the complete list of supported languages, and how to write language
names, see the [PrismJS homepage][3].

    ```javascript
    var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
    alert(s);
    ```

    ```python
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
    ```

    ```
    No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
    But let's throw in a &lt;b&gt;tag&lt;/b&gt;.
    ```

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting"
alert(s)
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

## Line highlighting & numbering

[gatsby-remark-prismjs][1] has its own line highlighting & numbering implementation which
differs a bit from PrismJS's own. You can find out everything about it in the
[corresponding README][1].

    ```javascript{1-2,22}{numberLines: true}
    // In your gatsby-config.js
    // Let's make this line very long so that our container has to scroll its overflow…
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
        options: {
          plugins: [
            {
              resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
              options: {
                maxWidth: 756,
              },
            },
            {
              resolve: `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe`,
              options: {
                wrapperStyle: `margin-bottom: 1.0725rem`,
              },
            },
            `gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files`,
            `gatsby-remark-smartypants`,
            `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

```javascript{1-2,22}{numberLines: true}
// In your gatsby-config.js
// Let's make this line very long so that our container has to scroll its overflow…
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-remark-images`,
          options: {
            maxWidth: 756,
          },
        },
        {
          resolve: `gatsby-remark-responsive-iframe`,
          options: {
            wrapperStyle: `margin-bottom: 1.0725rem`,
          },
        },
        `gatsby-remark-copy-linked-files`,
        `gatsby-remark-smartypants`,
        `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
      ],
    },
  },
]
```

Line numbers can start from anywhere, here's an example showing a small extract from a larger chunk of code:

    ```{numberLines: 549}
    ...
    a long imaginary code block
    ...
    ```

```{numberLines: 549}
...
 a long imaginary code block
...
```

Let's do something crazy and add a list with another code example:

- **A list item**

  …and a paragraph! In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me
  some advice that I’ve been turning over in my mind ever since.

  1.  A nested numbered list
  2.  “Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,” he told me, “just remember
      that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve
      had.”

- Roger that, now back to topic: _Highlighted code blocks work here, too:_

  ```css{10,13}
  .clearfix:after {
    visibility: hidden;
    display: block;
    font-size: 0;
    content: " ";
    clear: both;
    height: 0;
  }
  .clearfix {
    display: inline-table;
  }
  /* Hides from IE-mac \*/
  * html .clearfix {
    height: 1%;
  }
  .clearfix {
    display: block;
  }
  /* End hide from IE-mac */
  ```

  Wow, "IE-mac"?
  [Yeah, that was a thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_for_Mac)
  back in the day … a good one at the time, too:

  > Initial versions were developed from the same code base as Internet Explorer
  > for Windows. Later versions diverged, particularly with the release of
  > version 5 which included the cutting edge,
  > [fault-tolerant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault-tolerant) and highly
  > standards-compliant
  > [Tasman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_(layout_engine)>) >
  > [layout engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layout_engine).

- **The last list item** –- no more list items after this one, pinky swear!
