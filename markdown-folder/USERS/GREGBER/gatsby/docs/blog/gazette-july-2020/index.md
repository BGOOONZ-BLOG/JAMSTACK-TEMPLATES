July was full of ordinary items [revealed to be cakes üç∞](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a33313974/cake-meme-explained/), and extraordinary websites powered by Gatsby Themes!

It‚Äôs been a year since we unveiled [Gatsby Themes](/docs/themes/what-are-gatsby-themes/) and celebrated the release with ‚ÄúTheme Jam‚Äù, a hackathon that produced dozens of [powerful and beautiful projects](https://themejam.gatsbyjs.org/showcase). A Gatsby Theme is like a Gatsby plugin that includes a gatsby-config.js file, and can add pre-configured functionality, data sourcing, and/or UI code to Gatsby sites. In the beginning we saw most developers focus on the UI capabilities of themes. A year later we see themes package, split, and combine functionality for every common website use case you can think of! [Search ‚Äútheme‚Äù in the plugins directory](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/?=theme) to discovery over 400 Gatsby Themes you can use for your own projects.

July was also a huge month for official Gatsby Themes. We [updated our popular Blog Theme to 2.0](/blog/2020-07-08-blog-2.0/) and introduced better image support, search engine optimization, webfont configuration, and more. We also made it easier to swap styles for your blog, using Theme-UI presets. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the name ‚Äúblog‚Äù though. This theme is the perfect add-on for any site that needs to continually publish content. The lead engineer on the theme, [Laurie Barth](https://laurieontech.com/) also revamped [the step-by-step Gatsby Blog Theme tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/using-a-theme/), so you can get started customizing this theme quickly.

Also this month, we released a new official theme for adding [i18n support to your Gatsby site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2020-07-28-introducing-gatsby-i18n-theme/)! This i18n theme gives you access to specialized React components that help with building a multilingual site. The lead developer on this theme, [Lennart J√∂rgens](https://www.lekoarts.de/) also created 3 ‚Äúchild themes‚Äù for popular translation libraries. The i18n theme is great to use for any project that requires localization, but is also a solid example to study if you want to [build your own Gatsby Theme](/tutorial/building-a-theme/).

## üöÄ New in Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud!

### Gatsby Cloud Workspaces

Also in July we shipped Workspaces, a major improvement to how you can use Gatsby Cloud. New sites can be added to a Workspace from any repository or organization in GitHub, not just your own. And now you can create new Workspaces with separate subscriptions, giving you the flexibility to organize your sites to match your needs (especially when you need to set up a client‚Äôs account for them). [Sign up to Gatsby Cloud for free](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/dashboard/signup) to give Workspaces a spin.

### Enhanced WordPress Integration with Gatsby Cloud

Gatsby [released the BETA](/blog/2020-07-07-wordpress-source-beta/) of our new source plugin for WordPress, and it comes packed with lots of new features and improvements. Your Content Editors will love the integration with Gatsby Cloud, including Gatsby Preview and [near real-time builds](https://willit.build/details/type/blog/source/wordpress/page-count/512). Even if you haven‚Äôt built a website with WordPress before, we think this new source plugin will make the Gatsby / [headless WordPress](/docs/glossary/headless-wordpress/) stack a joy to experiment with.

### Faster Builds for Sites Using Static Queries

Previously [static query](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-query/) results in Gatsby were imported as JSON by webpack. This means that static query results were included in your site's JavaScript bundles. With this change static query results are instead loaded by the Gatsby runtime and now live outside of the webpack pipeline. The result? Much faster builds for your site, if it uses static queries.

### Improved Architecture for Gatsby

[This change](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/25716) is a rewrite of the way the `develop` command runs a build. It coordinates the process, replacing lots of watchers and events spread throughout the codebase with one central state machine that handles the process. This new architecture prevents lots of race conditions and subtle bugs, and opens the door for many new possibilities üòâ.
