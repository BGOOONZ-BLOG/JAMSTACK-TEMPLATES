# Accordion

<Yard placeholderHeight={180} {...accordionYardConfig} />

Accordions display a list of high-level options that can expand/contract to reveal more detailed information.

## Accessibility

- `tab`, `shift + tab` - to switch between panels.
- `space` or `enter` - when focus is on the accordion panel header it will toggle (expand or
  collapse) the currently focused panel.

## Examples

<Example title="Custom Accordion" path="accordion/custom.js">
  <CustomPanel />
</Example>

<Example title="Accordion basic usage" path="accordion/basic.js">
  <BasicAccordion />
</Example>

<Example
  title="Using a stateful panel component on it's own"
  path="accordion/stateful-panel.js"
>
  <StatefulPanelExample />
</Example>

<Example title="Stateless Accordion" path="accordion/stateless.js">
  <StatelessAccordion />
</Example>

If you want to control the `expanded` state of the accordion panels yourself, you can use the stateless version of our accordion: `StatelessAccordion`. You can pass a list of React keys to `expanded`, which corresponds to the keys of the `Panels` that you want to be expanded.

The `onChange` handler is called when one of the `Panels` would ordinarily be opened. It passes both the `key` of the `Panel` that caused the handler to fire as well as an updated `expanded` list. You can choose to use the new `expanded` list or `key` however you like to update your state. Note, by default the new `expanded` list will assume only one panel can be open at a time, but if you pass `accordion={false}` the `expanded` list will assume multiple can be open simultaneously.

The `StatelessAccordion` gives you the flexibility to control the accordion as you like while still offering some convenience to cover the normal use cases.

## API

<ApiTable
  title="Accordion props"
  config={accordionYardConfig}
  types={require('!!extract-react-types-loader!../../../src/accordion/accordion.js')}
/>

**Note:** the `Panel` has the same overrides as `Accordion`, with the exception of the `Root` subcomponent.

<Exports
  component={AccordionExports}
  title="Accordion exports"
  path="baseui/accordion"
/>
