  Using Multiple Themes
</h1>

This repository demonstrates how to use multiple themes in a Gatsby site

---

In this section you will see how to compose multiple themes into a final site using [gatsby-theme-blog](/packages/gatsby-theme-blog/), [gatsby-theme-notes](/packages/gatsby-theme-notes/) and [gatsby-mdx-embed](/packages/@pauliescanlon/gatsby-mdx-embed/) as examples. It will also cover the concept of component shadowing with [Theme-UI](/docs/theme-ui/) for styling.

## ðŸ”§ Running locally

The site can be run locally on your own computer as well by following these steps:

1.  Clone the `gatsby` repository

```shell
git clone git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby.git
```

2.  Navigate to the example

```shell
cd gatsby/examples/using-multiple-themes
```

3.  Install the dependencies for the application by running

```shell

npm install

```

4.  Run the Gatsby development server

```shell
gatsby develop
```

The site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`, you can see your first post at `http://localhost:8000/hello-posts/`
