# About

My name is Greg Berg√©, I am a french developer based in Paris. I discovered React in 2016 and I fell in love with it! After [many projects](https://gregberge.com/projects) and during [the workshops](https://gregberge.com/workshops) I gave, I had the chance to use [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

It was a revelation for me, [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/) would be the **next stack to build the web**.

Today [Gatsby](http://gatsbyjs.com/) is the most popular framework to create static generated applications using React. It makes it very easy and hides all the complexity behind it. However it remains difficult to start a project from scratch.

In july 2019, [Gatsby announced the stable release of Gatsby Themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-07-03-announcing-stable-release-gatsby-themes/). It opened a new era, an era where we can create a website without styling and coding everything. You can use an existing theme and start to write content.

## Motivation

I was looking for good Gatsby themes to create a new project and I couldn't find one that suits me. Inspired by [jamstackthemes.dev](https://jamstackthemes.dev/), I decided to create a website to reference all ready-to-use themes for Gatsby.

The goal is not to accept every theme, only **high quality themes** will take place here.

To create a curated list of best templates, I trust the community. This website is open source and will remain so. Everybody can [submit a new theme](https://github.com/gregberge/jamtemplates.com#submit-a-theme) by creating a pull-request. The theme is reviewed by the community.

## Future

As of today, you will only find free Gatsby themes on JamTemplates. This is just the beginning!

### Other frameworks

I choose the name JamTemplates because I want to create a registry of the best templates to create websites using [JamStack](https://jamstack.org/).

Lots of tools are available today, not all of them provide an easy way to create a theme. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) will probably be the next one to be referenced here.

### Premium themes

All work merits salary. Creating a high quality theme requires time and lot of work. Selling premium themes on JamTemplates is a something that would happen sooner or later.

Even if premium themes appear, I would like to keep this website open source. Everyone should be able to add his free or premium theme on JamTemplates.
