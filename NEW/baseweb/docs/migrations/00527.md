# Purpose

The purpose of this change was to allow the `toaster` utility to be used in server rendered environments.

- We have removed the `toaster.create({ placement: PLACEMENT.bottomRight })` method and `<Toaster />` component in favor of the `<ToasterContainer placement={PLACEMENT.bottomRight} />` component
- As before, the `<ToasterContainer />` only needs to be include once per React tree

## toaster

Removed `toaster.create()` method in favor of new `ToasterContainer` component

```diff
-  toaster.create: function(props)
+ <ToasterContainer {...props} />
```

## Toaster

Removed `Toaster` component

```diff
-  Toaster: React.Element
```
