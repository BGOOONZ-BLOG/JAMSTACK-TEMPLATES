Whether we gather in person or online, Gatsby Days conferences are all about the collective experiences and perspectives of the amazing Gatsby community ðŸ’œ.

The next Gatsby Days will take place on June 2-3, 2020, from 9:00am-12:00pm PST each day. This is a virtual event and will be live-streamed on YouTube. This means all speakers will need a computer, decent internet connection, and some kind of microphone/camera setup (the camera in your computer is great!) All speakers will receive a \$500.00 stipend from Gatsby following the conference.

Please make sure to [submit your proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjUpqpmRL18ydo_PmC4jxvPG8xhOlix43KeRHOhUbPp3u7Mw/viewform?usp=sf_link) NO LATER THAN Friday, April 24th, 2020 at 11:59pm PST. We are reviewing submissions as they come in, so submitting early is an advantage.
