## Hackle my code

# Idea

Make a board of some sort where developers of any language can post some code they would like to improve but don't
necessarely know how.

Other users should be able to participate by posting their own examples of what would be the
best possible refactoring and explain why.

The goal is to allow everyone to learn best practices, and write better code, using real examples.

# The minimum viable product:

- no signin/signup
- categories or tags for the different programming languages
- code highlighting
- should allow users to reply with one or more refactoring examples, with some explanations
