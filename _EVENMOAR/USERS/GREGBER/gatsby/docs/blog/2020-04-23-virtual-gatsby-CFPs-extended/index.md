We are seeking speakers to share knowledge about all things Gatsby, at every level of experience. **If you have an idea for presentation, please [check out this page](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjUpqpmRL18ydo_PmC4jxvPG8xhOlix43KeRHOhUbPp3u7Mw/viewform?usp=sf_link) for how to submit your proposal**. If you donâ€™t have one for this year but know someone else who would make a solid addition to the Virtual Gatsby Days lineup, please encourage them to submit.

Due to current events, this yearâ€™s summer Gatsby Days will be virtual: live-streamed on YouTube June 2-3, 2020, from 9:00am-12:00pm PST each day. This means all speakers will need a computer, decent internet connection, and some kind of microphone/camera setup (the camera in your computer is great!) All speakers will receive a \$500.00 stipend from Gatsby following the conference.
