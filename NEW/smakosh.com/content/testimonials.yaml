  review: Ismail is one of the most talented hardest working software engineers I've ever worked with. I've worked with him on several projects including JavaScript and React Native projects. Every time he's proven to be incredibly smart, hardworking and trustworthy. He writes beautiful, thoughtful code and isn't afraid to jump head first into technologies. He's even gone so far as to write his own CSS front end framework and hosted several conference talks

  review: I never worked with Smakosh but he caught my attention as a good React and Gatsby developer, blogger, contributor. Just looking at his website's sourcecode makes me feel confident he is someone I'd like to work with. His way of acting publicly makes me feel he's smart and has a long term vision that can only succeed.

  review: Working with Ismail felt very smooth and productive. He got used to the existing code base quickly and was able to execute productive tasks from the first day on. His wide knowledge and high working speed make him an ideal partner to meet project deadlines when time runs short. Ismail is a friendly, interested and target-oriented person with a true coder mind. I'd work with him again anytime!
