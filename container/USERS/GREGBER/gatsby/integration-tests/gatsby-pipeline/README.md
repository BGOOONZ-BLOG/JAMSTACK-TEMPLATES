# gatsby-pipeline

It's a default gatsby starter to test our build & develop pipeline.

## Install

You can install all dependencies by running `yarn` or `npm install`.

## Tests

To run our test suite you can simply run `yarn test`. If you want to test with the latest sources from the packages directory. You can use the [e2e-test.sh](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/scripts/e2e-test.sh) helper script that we use for CI. You can run it as `sh scripts/e2e-test.sh integration-tests/gatsby-pipeline` from the root directory.
