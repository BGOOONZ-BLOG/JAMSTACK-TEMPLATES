# Principles

## Common Language

Referring to a Button should mean the same thing across all render
targets. Using a Button in Sketch or Figma should translate directly
to a Button in Preact or React Native.

## Baked and Composable

Sens8 contains a cross-platform UI kit and design language that
encapsulates the relationships between the design tokens. Users
should be able to build entire sites and apps without having to touch
low-level implementation details like CSS. It should, however, be easy
to build new components, or integrate 3rd party components, that fit
with the core library.

## Forward Looking

Sens8 is meant to push boundaries and is partially an experimental
area for exploring how to merge design and engineering to a greater
degree. This means Sens8 leans heavily towards beta level software.
