# Tux

Tux is a penguin character and the official brand character of the Linux kernel.[1] Originally created as an entry to a Linux logo competition, Tux is the most commonly used icon for Linux, although different Linux distributions depict Tux in various styles. The character is used in many other Linux programs and as a general symbol of Linux.

An image of Tux can be resolved directly in markdown

![Tux](../public/tux.png)

It can also be resolved using explicit relative paths

![Tux](../public/tux.png)

Images may also link to external URLs. For example, the following image is downloaded from Wikipedia

![Tux original](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Tux.png)

To link to your images from your components add a `public` directory and store in it your images.

Then, in your code, link to your image (tux.png) by pointing to `/public`, for example : 

```jsx
  <img src="/public/tux.png" />
```

You can also customise the public folder to be anything you want by changing the `public` field in your `doczrc.js` file.

import Image from './index.jsx'

<Image />
