# Supported Platforms

Base Web supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. **While for now we support IE11, we may drop that in the near future.**

<Table
  columns={['Browser', 'Supported version']}
  data={[
    ['Chrome', '>= 58'],
    ['Firefox', 'ESR'],
    ['Safari', '>= 10.1'],
    ['Edge', '>= 16'],
    ['Internet Explorer', '11'],
    ['iOS Safari', '>= 10.3'],
    ['Android', '>= 4.4'],
  ]}
/>

**If you decide to opt-in to use the [overrides](https://baseweb.design/guides/understanding-overrides/) property, you are responsible to make sure it works in all browsers, as we cannot guarantee that.**
