## What are CSS Grid systems?

---
import Box from './Box.js'

<Box>
  A grid system is a structure that allows for content to be stacked both vertically and horizontally in a consistent and easily manageable fashion.
  <br /><br />Additionally, grid system code is project-agnostic giving it a high degree of portability so that it may be adopted on new projects.
</Box>

---

## Reasons we need them

<Steps>

- They increase productivity
- Help a lot for responsive layouts

</Steps>

---

## Life before CSS

In before, we were using HTML tables to code the UI

> We still do for email templates

---

## Life after CSS

A month and 11 days after my birthday, CSS was initially released on December 17, 1996

---

## Let's all float but...

Then almost every developer started exploring CSS and migrating from HTML tables using CSS float but there was this issue

---
import clearFixImage from './images/clearfix.jpg'

<Box>
  <img src={clearFixImage} alt="clearfix example" />
</Box>

---

## Clearfix hack

There has been a hack before but unfortunately it wasn't a general one until this came along

```css
.row:after {
  content: ""
  display: table
  clear: both
}
```

---

## Examples of a CSS float grid system

- Bootstrap's 3 Grid
- Materialize CSS
- Unnamed CSS

[Example from scratch](https://codepen.io/Smakosh/pen/yRwOwB)

---

## Hello FlexBox

Then few years later, FlexBox got introduced which is way better than using floats

But it is only a 1 dimensional system

[How Bootstrap 4's Grid system is](https://codepen.io/Smakosh/pen/MPZEwg)

---

import Grid from './images/grid.png'

<Box>
  <img src={Grid} alt="grid example" />
</Box>

---

## React Flex Ready

How I come up with React Flex Ready

`max-width: ${({ col, gap = 1 }) => (col && col < 12 ? `${100 * col / 12 - gap}%` : "100%")};`

[Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-flex-ready-example-q6fdg)

--- 

## Oh Hi CSS Grid

Finally CSS Grid came along which is a two dimensional grid-based layout system

which changed the way we implement and even design our grid based user interfaces.

import CssGrid from './images/css-grid.png'

<Box>
  <img src={CssGrid} alt="CSS grid example" />
</Box>
