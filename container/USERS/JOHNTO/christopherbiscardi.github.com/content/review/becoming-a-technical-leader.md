# Why

##### Why did I read this book?

As part of attempting to build my own company and the leadership
positions I've had at companies like Docker and Dropbox, I have a
vested interest in being a better leader. This book was suggested to
me as a good book on the topic.

#### Why should you read this book?

Anyone who wants to (or does) work with teams of people and wants to
increase leverage for those they work with.

#### What did I get out of it

The book ended up solidifying and expanding ideas that I've already
had and put into practice. In this way it was useful to read a more
concrete exposition of those ideas. It was fairly interesting to map
the concepts presented in this book to my own life.

# Review

## Modeling the world: Linear vs Organic

The book starts by exploring the definition of leadership in the
context of different kinds of modeling. There is some light talk
about psychology and the chapter comes to focus on Organic modeling
vs Linear modeling. 

> Organic models can be contrasted with linear models on several
> dimensions: the way events are explained, the way a person is
> defined, the way a relationship is defined, and the attitude towards
> change.

I found the description of organic modeling that occurred throughout
the book to be useful and interesting.

> *Leadership* is the process of creating an environment in which
> people become empowered.

## Organizing Life

The author tells stories about pinball players as a way to describe
what it takes to achieve effects that require nontrivial
effort. Desire is not enough to drive real improvement.

> Their lives just weren't sufficiently organized to learn anything
> that required a nontrivial effort.

This leads to the MOI model of leadership: Motivation, Organization,
and Ideas or Innovation. I found this to be a useful model when
reflecting on the problems I've seen and heard about at startups in
the Bay Area (where I do most of my work).

## Organizing Innovation

> *All* of the most consistently successful technical leaders empower 
> people by the value they place on innovation, on doing things in a
> better way.

The author goes on to describe the three main areas that characterize
the *problem-solving* leadership style as well as show examples of M,
O, and I based approaches.

* understanding the problem
* managing the flow of ideas
* maintaining quality

## On Improving

The next section of the book went through what it takes to get to the
next level of skill. The author describes a series of cliffs and
plateaus which are progressed through by trying new strategies. It is
important to note that by trying these new strategies, one might move
backward temporarily before hitting the next plateau.

I've experienced this myself with Volleyball, and other aspects of my
life, Where learning to serve a ball with a different contact style
might cause a higher percentage of misses before becoming a
significantly better serve.

> When you begin to feel you're really getting good, start looking for
> some conceptual breakthrough

## On Systems

This section goes into some detail about how leadership and
management are not the same in the organic approach (as opposed to the
linear approach). Especially with the recent rise of microservices and
emphasis on design systems, delving into a systems based approach
should feel familiar to many working engineers/designers/etc.

> Because it's an operating system, inefficiency under load is likely
> to stem from interactions between modules, not from individual
> modules behaving inefficiently

The above quote reminds me of a style of manager whose actions pin the
failures of a team on individual ICs rather than the environment and
interactions that occurred. Teams can be motivated and have useful
ideas and innovations but if the organization of the team itself and
the relationship to the rest of the organization is poorly handled, it
will destroy most of the value that could be created and you will lose
the team to better opportunities.

## Obstacles to Innovation

The author next describes three great obstacles to innovation in an
effort to move from theory to practice. The obstacles are personal in
that one should evaluate themselves to find out if they are blocking
their own progress.

1. self-blindness, concealing your own behavior, so you have no chance
   of changing
2. No-Problem Syndrome, convincing you that you already know the
   answer to all problems
3. belief in the central dogma of academic psychology, blinding you to
   alternative solutions, even ones you could generate without help
   from anyone else

## Developing Idea Power

> Any real problem has one *more* solution, which nobody has
> found--yet.

The idea of this chapter is that binding yourself to there being a
"right" answer is debilitating when approaching problem-solving. Even
if there is truly only one answer, it is useful to approach a problem
with a specific mentality for potential solutions.

## Vision

How success can lead to failure (or how what got you here won't get
you there). The solution that solved the problem yesterday isn't
something you should hang on to when the time comes to develop new
approaches. Developing personal vision is useful to a problem-solving
leader for a number of reasons. Quality, as referenced earlier in the
book, is defined as something that a leader with vision has the
required obsession over. I liked this framing of quality because I
felt that earlier in the book quality was given a very subjective
definition (or rather, not given a definition at all).

## Obstacles to Motivation

One idea that really resonated with me in this chapter was the idea
that sacrificing people's future possibilities to achieve something
now is often the wrong move, especially for complex technical and
creative matters. I appreciated the acknowledgment that there are two
sides to this:

> If you put the people ahead of the work, you may hurt your chances
> of succeeding with your project; but the people will be around long
> after the project has been forgotten, doing other projects and
> affecting the lives of other people.

I also appreciated the following conclusion, which is that a people
first approach is the best move in the end.

> In a complex environment, even the most task-oriented leader is
> forced to put people first, or the task won't get done.

I heavily agree with the people-first approach, especially when
considering how tight knit the industry is (especially in the Bay
Area). One quote really stuck with me:

> If you can't do the task without exploiting people, perhaps you
> shouldn't do it at all

## Power Conversion

The chapter on gaining organizational power is interesting in that it
describes power conversion vs point accumulation. Whenever someone
says you are "earning points" or "paying dues" it is unlikely to pay
off. Instead, take stock of what power you have (technical competence,
positional power, etc) and find out how to use that to get where you
want to go. The author goes on to describe how realizing this
experience can be translated from gaining power for yourself to
gaining power for the use of others. Gaining power for the use of
others is far more interesting because there is a compounding effect
on such use.

> Some new team leaders merely continue to use their tactics to obtain
> what *they* need, not what their team members need ... most don't
> understand the leader's role, to create an environment in which
> *everyone* is empowered.

## Making Time

The book continues on and eventually comes to the topic of "making
time" in a day.

* Don't do things you've already assigned to others, even if you must
  let them make mistakes
* Avoid administration like the plague
* Don't waste time trying to prove your competence
* Don't waste time arguing about wasting time
* Pay attention to what you do when there's nothing to do
* Get at least two for the price of one
* Act as review leader
* Act as editor
* Be a tutor
* Coordinate a speaking or training program
* Use your car pool
* Share the reading load
* Have a good lunch, but a creative one

to which two are added

* Listen to what other people have already learned
* Let other people show you how smart they are

## Bibliography

The bibliography is large, consisting of at least 22 authors and their
books. It does, however, have nice summaries of why you would want to
read each book. This makes prioritizing any choice much easier.

I've compiled an [amazon list][list] of all of the books in the
bibliography with the exception of one, for which I chose the updated
and expanded version.
