# jest-editor-support

The engine that allows editors to build on top of Jest.

## Usage

This is only useful if you are interested in building an editor integration for
Jest.

For now as an end user, we'd recommend looking at either
[vscode-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/) or
[majestic](https://github.com/Raathigesh/majestic/).

## Note

Since version `18.2.0` TypeScript is now a peer dependency. If you don't need to
handle `.tsx` files then you can safely ignore the warning during installation.
