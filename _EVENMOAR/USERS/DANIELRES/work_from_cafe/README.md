A reference for people working remotely who donâ€™t want to sit at home.  
A list of places friendly to social oriented geeks. And it's on GitHub. Love it already?

###How to contribute?
Got a favourite cafe and wanna add it to the list?

This is done by geeks and for geeks so you need to use Github.

Eight easy steps using just GitHub web interface:

1. Open project's webpage on Github.  
2. Navigate to __index.json__ file and open it.  
3. Click __Fork and edit this file__ button.  
4. Add a new cafe following json formatting you see in a file.  
5. Use http://jsonlint.com/ to check json file or if you have ruby installed run rspec spec-s.  
6. Don't forget a proper commit msg at the bottom.  
7. You will see GitHub Pull request page.  
8. Fill it, press __Send pull request__.  
9. As you're the author now, you're totally welcome to add yourself to humans.txt :) <http://humanstxt.org/>
