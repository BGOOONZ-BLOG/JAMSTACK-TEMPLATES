# Roadmap

_The last update: 12 March 2020_

If you want to see what we are working on and what won't be worked on, you've come to the right place.

## Next up

Items are not necessarily in priority order.

<Table
  columns={['Feature']}
  data={[
    ['Support for nested overrides in the playground'],
    ['Better mobile support for all components'],
    ['Updated visuals for the sidebar and tree view components'],
    ['The next major, v10 (see below)'],
  ]}
/>

## Not planned

The following items won't be included in any future Base Web releases.

<Table
  columns={['Feature']}
  data={[['Support for react-form, formik, or similar out of the box']]}
/>

## The next major

We have a new major version, **v10**, planned for **September of 2021**. Below you will find all of the potentially breaking changes we are including in v10. To provide a seamless upgrade experience, we'll ship codemods for all changes.

We will keep this list updated to give you as much time to prepare as possible. Also, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/issues) if you want to discuss any of the changes.

### `baseui/label`

- The `timePickerAriaLabel` prop will be removed in favor of `timePickerAriaLabel12Hour` or `timePickerAriaLabel24Hour`.

### `baseui/modal`

- The `Backdrop` override property will be removed in favor of `DialogContainer`.
- The `unstable_ModalBackdropScroll` prop will be removed and become the default behavior.
- The `autofocus` prop will be removed in favor of `autoFocus`.

### `baseui/phone-input`

- The design will be updated to split the dial code selector into a separate control (`CountryPicker`). Available now as [`PhoneInputNext`](https://baseweb.design/components/phone-input/#updated-phone-input-design). In v11, `PhoneInputNext` will replace the current default implementation (`PhoneInput`).
- The `CountrySelect` component will be removed in favor of `CountryPicker`.

### `baseui/spinner`

- The design will be updated to use a fill without rounded corners. Available now as [`StyledSpinnerNext`](https://baseweb.design/components/spinner/#spinner-next). In v11, `StyledSpinnerNext` will replace the current default implementation (`Spinner`).

### `baseui/theme`

- The `zIndex` theme property will be removed in favor of the [`Layers`](https://baseweb.design/components/layer/) system.
- The `tooltip` theme property will be removed in favor of the `colors.tooltipBackground` and `colors.tooltipText` properties. [Further context](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/pull/1184).
- The legacy set of semantic color properties will be removed. You can use the following mapping to update to the newer set of semantic color properties:
  - `colorPrimary` -> `contentPrimary`
  - `colorSecondary` -> `contentSecondary`
  - `background` -> `backgroundPrimary`
  - `backgroundAlt` -> `backgroundSecondary`
  - `backgroundInv` -> `backgroundInversePrimary`
  - `foreground` -> `contentPrimary`
  - `foregroundAlt` -> `contentSecondary`
  - `foregroundInv` -> `contentInversePrimary`
  - `border` -> `borderOpaque`
  - `borderAlt` -> `borderTransparent`
  - `borderFocus` -> `borderSelected`
  - `borderError` -> `borderNegative`
  - `shadowFocus` -> `-`
  - `shadowError` -> `-`
- There will be more refactoring of the theme, but not all of the details have been decided on yet. Track [this issue](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/issues/2318) if interested.

### `baseui/accordion`

- The `renderPanelContent` prop will be removed in favor of [`renderAll`](https://baseweb.design/components/accordion/#accordion-seo-friendly).

### `baseui/checkbox`

- The `checkmarkType` prop will use [`STYLE_TYPE.toggle_round`](https://baseweb.design/components/checkbox/#as-a-toggle) as the default value.
- Unlabeled checkboxes will no longer receive padding on the right side. [Further context](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/pull/2172).

### `baseui/progress-bar`

- The `successValue` prop will be removed. The `value` prop should be normalized as though `successValue` were always set to `100`.

### `baseui/radio`

- All overrides on the `RadioGroup` component will be removed except for `RadioGroupRoot`. Overrides should be passed to `Radio` children instead.

### `baseui/select`

- The `StyledSearchIcon` component will be removed in favor of `StyledSearchIconContainer`. [Further context](https://github.com/uber/baseweb/pull/2397).

### `baseui/typography`

- The older typography components will be removed in favor of the newer typography components. The older components already alias the newer components according to this mapping:
  - `Display` -> `DisplayLarge`
  - `Display1` -> `DisplayLarge`
  - `Display2` -> `DisplayMedium`
  - `Display3` -> `DisplaySmall`
  - `Display4` -> `DisplayXSmall`
  - `H1` -> `HeadingXXLarge`
  - `H2` -> `HeadingXLarge`
  - `H3` -> `HeadingLarge`
  - `H4` -> `HeadingMedium`
  - `H5` -> `HeadingSmall`
  - `H6` -> `HeadingXSmall`
  - `Paragraph1` -> `ParagraphLarge`
  - `Paragraph2` -> `ParagraphMedium`
  - `Paragraph3` -> `ParagraphSmall`
  - `Paragraph4` -> `ParagraphXSmall`
  - `Label1` -> `LabelLarge`
  - `Label2` -> `LabelMedium`
  - `Label3` -> `LabelSmall`
  - `Label4` -> `LabelXSmall`
