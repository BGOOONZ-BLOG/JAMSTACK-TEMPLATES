unix-utilities
==============

Various small Unix utilities for ~/bin

These are all meant to work on ubuntu 13.10.
Most but not all will work on other Unix distributions.
If you have patches to make them work elsewhere, send them via pull request or another convenient method.

Some of them are simple bash scripts, others are written in ruby and require proper libraries to be installed.
