# Consulting

# UI Architecture Review

I can audit your existing UIs and configuration providing insight into how your
architecture can be evolved to remove barriers to engineers.

##### Why me?

At Docker I built the UI team as the company scaled from one design/ui person
into a full team juggling multiple projects. Our work spanned multiple
architectures including SSR setups and client-only. At Dropbox I was responsible
for reviewing and suggesting changes to the architecture due to my position on
an internal architecture group as well as my work on the Design Systems team.
I'm deeply familiar with modern toolsets such as the CSS-in-JS and GraphQL
ecosystems and can suggest the best application of tools such as Prettier.

# Design Systems and Component Libraries

I can help you start your designops or component system efforts.

#### Why me?

At Dropbox I helped start the design systems team, building out a new component
library which could be used across all products. I have a large amount of
experience with monorepo tools like lerna and yarn workspaces as well as
storybook and other styleguide setups.

# Containerization

An audit will surface potential size savings for large containers as well as
opportunities for automation. I can help build out development and production
containers using technology such as docker-compose and kubernetes.

##### Why me?

At Docker the team I ran built and deployed it's own infrastructure. We built
workflows in the early days and evolved them as newer tools such as
docker-compose became available, containerizing our development and production
environments. As a consultant, I've containerized everything from Go to Haskell
for production and built development environments with Postgres and other
stacks. These days I deal mostly with Kubernetes for production.

# JavaScript

# Go

Have a new or existing project that needs work? A tool that needs to be built
but no one has the time? I can help build tools for automation

##### Why me?

I started writing Golang at Docker in 2014. Since then it eclipsed Haskell as my
preferred language for microservices, CLIs, and containerized applications.
