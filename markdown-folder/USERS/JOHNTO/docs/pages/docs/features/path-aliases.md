With the microservices architecture, we break down the whole app into multiple independent programs: microservices. This architecture gives us a lot of benefits including:

- **Parallelize** workload by distributing ownership and responsibility across different teams.
- **Mix up** different languages, frameworks and even varied versions of those.
- **Scale** easily by adding more resources to independent microservices as needed.

With this architecture, now we have to deal with a lot of microservices. However, exposing them to the public is not a good idea. If we can hide these microservices under a single domain name, that will give us better results.

For example, let's say our app has two microservices as shown below:

```
- ui.our-domain.com
- api.our-domain.com
```

As it is not a good idea to expose these URLs to the public, we can map these services into our main domain like this:

```
- our-domain.com/api/** -> api.our-domain.com
- our-domain.com/** -> ui.our-domain.com
```

As our app evolves, we need to split the `ui` microservice into two: `frontend` and `admin`. We also need to add a new microservice for `/api/register` to handle the increasing load.

We can do a new mapping like this:

```
- our-domain.com/api/register -> api-register.our-domain.com
- our-domain.com/api/** -> api.our-domain.com
- our-domain.com/admin/** -> admin.our-domain.com
- our-domain.com/** -> frontend.our-domain.com
```

After this, we will have whole new microservices set up. However, our end users do not need to know about these changes.

> Hence, with this setup, we can manage the architecture of our microservices and change them at will without downtime or have to notify users.

## Path Alias

If you [manage](/docs/getting-started/assign-a-domain-name#2.-using-a-custom-domain,-managed-by-now) your domain inside ZEIT or [point it](/docs/getting-started/assign-a-domain-name#4.-using-a-custom-domain-with-a-cname) to `alias.zeit.co`, you can hide microservices under a domain as shown above with our "Path Alias" feature.

Here's how to do it.

Create a file called `rules.json` and add the following content:

```
{
  "rules": [
    { "pathname": "/api/register", "method": ["POST"], "dest": "api-register-wcepelgodl.now.sh" },
    { "pathname": "/api/**", "method": ["GET", "POST"], "dest": "api-tuhpdtgoja.now.sh" },
    { "dest": "ui-dbuyejqwio.now.sh" }
  ]
}
```

Then run the following command:

<TerminalInput>now alias our-domain.com -r rules.json</TerminalInput>

Every time you run the above command, the rules for `our-domain.com` will be updated without any downtime.

## API

As you have seen in the above example, you can define a set of rules. These rules are executed **in order**. An incoming HTTP request will be sent to the destination mentioned in the first matching rule.

A rule should contain the `dest` field and one or many optional fields including `pathname` and `method`. Here's a detailed definition of each of these fields.

#### dest

The destination of each rule should be one of the following:

- The unique now deployment URL like `mysite-wcepelgodl.now.sh`
- An alias like `our-app-ui.now.sh`
- An external hostname that may not point to a `now.sh` deployment.

> You can get the original hostname from the `x-forwarded-host` header.

### pathname (optional)

Incoming HTTP requests will be matched with the pathname format defined in the rule. The `pathname` field could have one of the following formats:

* **/api/register** - A strict path match
* **/user/*/profile** - A wildcard rule matches pathnames like `/user/rauchg/profile`
* **/api/**** - A wildcard rule matches pathnames with multiple segments like `/api/user/email` or `/api/login`

If there is no `pathname` field, all the requests will be a candidate for the rule (it is similar to having `/**` as the value for `pathname`).

Additionally the pathname will be forwarded to the destination as is. Here are some examples:

```
- /api/register -> my-api-register.now.sh/api/register
- /user/rauchg/profile -> my-ui.now.sh/user/rauchg/profile
- /api/v2/user/info -> my-api.now.sh/api/v2/user/info
```

### methods (optional)

This is a list of HTTP method types that the rule supports. It can have one or many methods like this:

```
{ "pathname": "/api/**", "method": ["GET", "POST"], "dest": "api-tuhpdtgoja.now.sh" }
```

If there is no `methods` field, requests with any HTTP method will be a candidate for the rule.

## Managing Rules

Have a look at the rules we have introduced previously:

```
{
  "rules": [
    { "pathname": "/api/register", "method": ["POST"], "dest": "api-register-wcepelgodl.now.sh" },
    { "pathname": "/api/**", "method": ["GET", "POST"], "dest": "api-tuhpdtgoja.now.sh" },
    { "dest": "ui-dbuyejqwio.now.sh" }
  ]
}
```

Destinations of these rules are unique <Now color="#000" /> deployment URLs. They will be changed every time you deploy a new version. Therefore, you need to update the rules again and again.

It works, but there is a better way to do this.

Have a look at the following set of rules.

```
{
  "rules": [
    { "pathname": "/api/register", "method": ["POST"], "dest": "my-api-register.now.sh" },
    { "pathname": "/api/**", "method": ["GET", "POST"], "dest": "my-api.now.sh" },
    { "dest": "my-ui.now.sh" }
  ]
}
```

Now for the `dest` field, instead of the deployment URL (`api-tuhpdtgoja.now.sh`), we now have an alias (`my-api.now.sh`).

Then we only need to set these rules once, unless you change the microservices setup.

With this setup, let's say you've deployed a new version of the "api microservice" and its deployment URL is `api-iewodtfalq.now.sh`.

Now simply map it to the alias like this:

<TerminalInput>now alias api-iewodtfalq.now.sh my-api.now.sh</TerminalInput>

You don't need to update path alias rules since `my-api.now.sh` points to the latest deployment.
