Good design is reactive/playful/informative/intuitive. Developers are
designers, too, as design isn't just about what things look like.

## What is good design?

It doesn't matter what you think, it matters what your users thinks.

### Reactive

Instant feedback and distinguishable states

  * Functional reactive programming -> event streams and properties
  * bacon.js

### Playful

#### The observer pattern and computed property macros

Leverage computed property macros to keep things DRY.
`Ember.service` and `.volatile()`.


### Informative

Visibility of System Status - Jakob Nielsen, 10 Heuristics for User Interface Design

Flash messages can inform users of what's going on during an interruption. See slides for code examples.

### Intutive

People are going to interact with your app in a way that is intuitive to them. Drag and drop!


## tl;dr

Design is about how it works.

Inform, give feedback, be interactive. Ember provides a great developer experience that allows
you to focus on the user.
